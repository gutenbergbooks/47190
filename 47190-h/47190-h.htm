<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few institutions in this or in any other
country the history of which is so little known as is that
of the post-office. The very name, in the opinion of the
masses, is sufficient to enlighten them; and beyond this
little or no interest is manifested. Yet the history, if
fairly written, would surprise that very portion who consider
the name alone an index to its unwritten pages.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems strange that so important a branch of
our government should have been so slighted by those
who constituted themselves historic writers. Our school-books
contain no allusion to it, nor are its officers mentioned
with any marks of commendation in any of our
national works. And yet there are names identified with
this department, both as regards mind, intellect, and character,
unequalled by those of any other in the country.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is looked upon as being merely an appliance
to the wheels of government and not essential to its
general movements. Is this so? is the department a
mere workshop and its officers and employees simply
workers?</p>

<p>We have endeavored in this work&mdash;perhaps feebly&mdash;to
place the &#8220;post&#8221; before our readers as one of the most
important branches of the General Government. We
have thrown around its social and political history an
interest by connecting with it incidents, facts, and local
matter more immediately identified with events which
have marked our country&#8217;s history from its earliest period
to that of the present.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Much has transpired during all these years to render
such a work both instructive and interesting; and although
we do not claim for ours any such pretension, yet we may
safely term it <i>a pioneer in the cause of our postal history</i>.</p>

<p>We have also endeavored, without any aid from the
postal department at Washington, to furnish a somewhat
desultory history of the post in this country, while at the
same time we have given some account of those of other
nations. Ours is not a mere statistic history, but one
that blends with it a certain amount of information upon
every subject more or less connected with it. Aiming at
no high literary attainments, or attempting to excel others
in language, beauty of sentiment, or construction of sentences,
he has written a work in his own style, and in a
manner which he flatters himself will be received favorably
by the masses. The American language given in
its plainest style will be far more appreciated by them
than if clothed in the classic garb scholastic and academical
<i>tailoring</i> has thrown around it.</p>

<p>The primitive style in which our forefathers wrote has
been materially changed by the introduction of foreign
and learned words. This, it is true, as Blair says, &#8220;gives
an appearance of elevation and dignity to style;&#8221; but
often, also, they render it stiff and forced; and, in general,
a plain native style, as it is more intelligible to all readers,
so, by a proper management of words, &#8220;it may be made
equally strong and expressive with this Latinized English.&#8221;
Barren languages may need such assistance, but ours is
not one of these.</p>

<p>The author is also aware that in the general arrangement
of his subject there may seem a want of connection;
but, as the postal chain is linked to dates, he may be
excused if other portions of the work fly off in tangents.
This, however, is owing more to the variety of postal
matter introduced than to any neglect on his part to
bring them into harmonic action.</p>

<p>The post-office, dry and uninteresting as its name alone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
implies, possesses an interest few people are aware. It is
not a mere commercial affair, but one that connects itself
with the interest of every man, woman, and child in the
country whose business and sympathies are alike linked
to its operations. There is not a country or a spot of
ground on the habitable globe where civilization, with its
handmaid, intellect, treads, but is identified with this vast
postal chain. Touch the wire at one end, and its vibration
may tend to enlighten even the land of the heathen.
The wire <i>has</i> been touched; for</p>

to extend the cause of Christianity, and which postal
facility, the enterprise of civilized nations, affords.</p>

<p>The author in a great measure had to rely upon his
own resources for all the postal information incorporated
in this work. The department at Washington and post-offices
throughout the country seem to consider the records
of the institution not of sufficient importance to be preserved
in such a manner as to make a reference to them
an easy matter.</p>

<p>To M. Hall Stanton, Esq., and Thomas H. Shoemaker,
Esq., the author feels highly indebted, not only for the
interest they have taken in the work, but for placing at
his disposal their valuable libraries and the loan of old
and rare works.</p>

<p>For the valuable statistical tables so carefully and so
well arranged, giving at a glance the <i>Ledger</i> account of
the financial postal department, the author is indebted to
William V. McKean, Esq., the able and talented editor of
&#8220;The National Almanac and Annual Record,&#8221;&mdash;a work,
to use the language of a distinguished public character,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
&#8220;which is a little library in itself, and one which answers
nearly all questions on public affairs in a most satisfactory
manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>To &#8220;the press&#8221; of our country, which has become its
historian, is the author indebted for much valuable matter
connected with the subject of the post. If from these
sources he has compiled a work calculated to place the
postal department in its proper light and render it in the
least instructive or interesting, he will be fully repaid for
the labor bestowed upon it.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">DEDICATION.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The custom of dedicating works to individuals is of
some antiquity, or, at least, as far as the antiquity of
book-making extends. At one period it served the double
purpose of creating a patron and enlarging the sale of
the book. Again, dedications became popular when great
men condescended to notice authors and placed their
extensive libraries at their disposal. Books published in
the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries afford
the curious reader rich specimens of this species of literary
composition.</p>

<p>Others, again, dedicated their works to men whose
opinions assimilated with their own. Thus, the philosopher
dedicated his work to one who was considered versed
in the mysteries of science; the poet dedicated his effusions
to an admirer of rhyme; the dramatist, to a well-known
patron of the stage and of the drama; the painter
dedicated his work on art to a connoisseur,&mdash;one whose
skill and judgment in the arts had secured him a &#8220;world-renowned
reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>In our day and country the sale of a book depends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
altogether upon its own merits and the <i>honest</i> criticism
of the press. Dedications, therefore, are looked upon as
one of those liberties an author can take with a friend,
and thus bring his name before the public in connection
with the work without being accused of selfish or interested
motives.</p>

<p>Just such a liberty the author of this work takes with
one whom he is proud to call friend,&mdash;one whose many
amiable qualities endear him to all. It is, therefore,
with much pleasure he dedicates this work to</p>

<p class="center">
<big><i>M. HALL STANTON, Esq.<br />
of Philadelphia</i>,</big><br />
</p>

<p>as a memento of friendship and of the many happy hours
that friendship has afforded.</p>

<b>Posts&mdash;Post-Offices, Ancient and Modern.</b></h2>

<p class="small">&#8220;The Post-office is properly a mercantile project. The Government advances
the expenses of establishing the different offices, and of buying or
hiring the necessary horses or carriages, and is repaid with a large profit
by the duties upon what is carried.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smith&#8217;s Wealth of Nations.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the earlier periods of society, communication between
the parts of a country was a rare and difficult undertaking.
Individuals at a distance, having little inclination and less
opportunity for such intercourse, were naturally satisfied
with their limited means of communicating one with
another.</p>

<p>As civilization advanced and trade became a national
feature, these communications became more important and,
of course, more frequent. Our readers will observe, as we
progress in this work, how it assumes at last one of the
most important branches of a government. Indeed, this
it was destined to become from the fact that it originated
with the people, and their interest made it a part and portion
of the great postal system.</p>

<p>Posts and post-offices, as understood in modern parlance,
are identified with trade and commerce, and in their connection
with <i>letters</i>. The word post, however, was used long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
before post-offices were established, implying a public establishment
of letters, newspapers, &amp;c. In the Roman Empire,
couriers, on swift horses, passed from hand to hand the
imperial edicts to every province. Private letters were
sent to their destination by slaves, or intrusted to casual
opportunities.</p>

<p>Although we are apt to stigmatize two of the greatest
nations of the earth&mdash;the Greeks and Romans&mdash;as being
uncivilized, and historically termed barbarians, yet were
they highly educated in many of the branches of literature,
art, and science. The posts were well known among
the Romans; yet is it difficult to trace with certainty the
period of their introduction. Some writers carry it back
to the time of the Republic,&mdash;posts and post-offices, under
the name of <i>statores</i> and <i>station</i>, having been then, it is
said, established by the Senate. Whether this was the case
or not, Suetonius assures us that Augustus substituted posts
along the great roads of the Empire. At first, the despatches
were conveyed from post to post by young men
running on foot and delivering them to others at the next
route. Post-horses are mentioned in the Theodosian Code,
<i>decursu publico</i>; but these were only the public horses for
the use of the government messengers, who, before this
institution was established, seized everything that came in
their way.</p>

<p>Horace speaks of the post as &#8220;means of conveying rapid
intelligence.&#8221; Flying posts in the days of Richard III.
were used for military purposes, imparting news of war,
victory, &amp;c. &#8220;<i>Equi positi</i>&#8221;&mdash;post-horses&mdash;were common
even before the idea of a general postage-system was conceived.
&#8220;Post-haste&#8221; is a familiar phrase among the old
poets. Drayton says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i7">&#8220;A herald posted away</div>
<div class="line i0">The King of England to the field to dare.&#8221;</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>Virgil, in one of his sublime epics, makes use of this expression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;Now Jove himself hath sent his fearful mandate through the skies:</div>
<div class="line i0">The post of gods is come!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After the introduction of letters and the conveyance of
messages, written and printed, the word post was understood
to mean &#8220;to ride or travel with post-horses;&#8221; &#8220;with
speed or despatch of post-horses.&#8221; What it means now in
such connection can only be explained by calculating the
speed of lightning.</p>

<p>The modern post and post-office form a part and portion
of a government, and act in concert with other great agents
of civilization in the formation of permanent institutions.</p>

<p>The post-office is one of those tests by which the progressive
prosperity of a country may be ascertained. In
this respect, perhaps no other nation in the world presents
a more extended view of such progress, in connection with
the postal system, than does that of the United States. In
the short space of eighty years she has set an example, by
the action and the enterprise of her people, to nations who
boast of a political and national existence of centuries.</p>

<p>The literary treasures of England,&mdash;accumulating from
Alfred, Bede, and Chaucer, through a succession of enlightened
ages, swelling up in their onward progress the
vast catalogue of science, connecting with their recorded
mental wealth the names of men who consecrated with
their genius the age in which they flourished,&mdash;did less
for her commercial interest, throughout all those periods,
than has the United States in less than fifty years.
Enterprise came forth under the light of liberty, and
extended its operations to every department of trade,
commerce, art, and science. England became alive to the
fact that a new people had created and given a living
principle to the mechanical workings in the world of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
trade and commerce. Its operations gave vigor to action,
and infused a spirit into merchants and traders which,
heretofore, followed in the wake of <i>monarchial follies</i>,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>We purpose to speak now of the post being a branch
of the government, and, in some respects, one of the most
important.</p>

<p>The post-office department should be, but it is not, a
social agent. The peculiar character of a republican
government is such that the post becomes essentially a
great political one. Its connection with an administration
is one of the links connecting party with its political
interests, and which becomes broken immediately on
the success attending that of a rival. It is rotary in its
motion; hence the various changes which necessarily occur
at elections have a tendency to retard, rather than advance,
the postal system on its road to perfection. Indeed,
it is not assuming too much if we say that civil liberty,
practically speaking, partly consists in these changes; for
opposition is an essential and vital element of such
liberty, and opposition, with these possible changes, would
have little or no meaning. If, however, they were limited
to the heads of the department, and not extending down
to the humblest workers in the office, the evil effects ever
attending on such changes would not so materially operate
against its interests, and, of course, that of the community.
A general sweep of the employees of any one State or government
department makes the whole system a gigantic political,
rather than what it should be, a social, institution.</p>

<p>In whatever light, however, we view the post-office, it
presents to us a subject of the highest interest. Connect
it with commerce, and it assumes the power of a &#8220;Merlin,&#8221;
whose magic wand, raised in the ages of superstition,
astonished the world! Connect it with the arts, and nations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
are brought together by the mere stroke of the pen!
Associate it with science, religion,&mdash;in fact, with any of the
prominent features which make up civilized life,&mdash;it becomes
at once the great medium through which their mysteries
and developments are made manifest to all.</p>

<p>Viewed historically, we trace the history of the post to
Moses, and the peopled countries, even to the children of
Canaan, in the swamps of Egypt. We link it with the
hieroglyphic, or symbolical, characters of that age, long
before Hermes substituted alphabetical signs. We follow
it up, through sacred and profane history, to the exclusive
royal messengers in Persia mentioned by Herodotus, and
the grant of the postal establishment as an imperial fief,
made by Charles V. to the princely family of Thurn and
Taxis, and from that down to the establishing of that system
which is now followed by all civilized nations.</p>

<p>The making a branch of a government an hereditary
one, particularly that of the postal, could only have originated
under the genial rule of Charles. The family of
Thurn and Taxis held the post-office as a fief, given to
them by the Emperor Charles V., and they continued to
hold it long after the different German States had become
independent. Of course, like all such fiefs, (even those of
<i>Saxon</i> notoriety,) it became, in time&mdash;instead of what the
true meaning implied, &#8220;fealty or fidelity,&#8221; to &#8220;keep and
sustain any thing granted and held upon oath, &amp;c.&#8221;&mdash;a
most vile and corrupt institution.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE FIRST RECORDED RIDING-POST.</i></h3>

<p>The first recorded riding-post was established in
Persia, by Cyrus, 599 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> Cyrus was the son of Cambyses,
King of Persia, and Mandane, daughter of Astyages,
King of the Medes. The history of Cyrus is a lesson
worthy to be read by all who can appreciate in one man
all those elements which combine to make a great one.
He was educated according to the Persian institutions, of
which Xenophon gives such glowing accounts. Among
the numerous inventions he made and carried into operation,
that of the posts and couriers, to facilitate the transportation
of letters, was probably the most important.
He caused post-houses to be built and messengers to be
appointed in every province. There were one hundred
and twenty provinces. Having calculated how far a good
horse with a brisk rider could go in a day, without being
spoiled, he had stables built in proportion, at equal distances
from each other, and had them furnished with
horses and grooms to take care of them. He likewise
appointed a &#8220;postmaster,&#8221; to receive the packets from
the couriers as they arrived, and give them to others,
and to take the horses and furnish fresh ones. Thus, the
post went continually, night and day, with extraordinary
speed. Herodotus speaks of the same sort of couriers in
the reign of Xerxes. He speaks of eleven <i>postal stages</i>,
a day&#8217;s journey distant from one another, between Susa
and the &AElig;gean Sea.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>These couriers were called in the Persian language by a
name signifying, as near as we can comprehend it, &#8220;service
by compulsion.&#8221; The superintendency of the posts became
a considerable employment. Darius, the last of the
Persian kings, had it before he came to the crown. Xenophon
notices the fact that this establishment subsisted still
in his time, which perfectly agrees with what is related in
the book of Esther concerning the edict published by
Ahasuerus in favor of the Jews, which edict was carried
through that vast empire with a rapidity that would have
been impossible without these posts erected by Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Persia, in some respects, has not kept pace with the progress
of other nations, or carried out those plans of government
and schemes which Cyrus originated in his early
reign. Traces of a race far more energetic than the present
inhabitants of Persia are found in various parts of the
kingdom. The ruins of many ancient cities scattered over
the land are imposing and grand, especially those of Persepolis.
Next to the pyramids of Egypt and the colossal
ruins of Thebes, they have attracted the attention of travellers,
and, like them, still remain an enigma,&mdash;their history,
dates, and objects being involved in the gloom of
antiquity. These evidences prove the existence of a state
of refinement in art in the sixth century, scarcely equalled,
certainly not excelled, since, and fully sustain the <i>data</i>
given to that wonderful discovery,&mdash;the establishing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
postal system and the first introduction of the &#8220;riding-post.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>In the highest eras of their civilization, neither the
Greeks nor the Romans had a public letter-post; though
the conveyance of letters is as much a matter of necessity
and convenience as the conveyance of persons and merchandise.</p>

<p>There were <i>stationese</i> and mounted messengers, called
<i>tabellarii</i>, who went in charge of the public despatches;
but they were strictly forbidden to convey letters for private
persons.</p>

<p>In the time of Augustus, post-houses were established
throughout the kingdom, and post-horses stationed at
equal distances to facilitate the transmission of letters, &amp;c.
Under his reign, literature flourished, many salutary laws
were established, and he so embellished Rome that he was
declared &#8220;to have found it brick and left it marble.&#8221; He
was born at Rome, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 63, and died at Nola in the seventy-sixth
year of his age.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the fact of nations, considerably
advanced in civilization at the early period of the world&#8217;s
history, being without a public post for the conveyance of
letters. Yet, when we take into consideration that trade and
commerce were then in their infancy, simple messengers
only were required. Indeed, letters at that period were
only written when great occasions called them forth.
What with us is now a pleasure, was with the ancients
a task.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 807 that a postal service was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
established by the Emperor Charlemagne,&mdash;a service which
did not survive him. This, however, differed very little
from that which was framed by Cyrus.</p>

<p>The first actual letter-post system, connecting countries
together by communications, furthering the cause of trade
and commerce, and established to facilitate the conveyance
of letters throughout the commercial world, originated in
the manufacturing and business districts of the &#8220;Hanse
Towns.&#8221; The confederacy was established in 1169.</p>

<p>So early as the thirteenth century this federation of the
republics required constant communication with each other;
and it became almost a necessity of their existence that
some letter-post system should be established.</p>

<p>The society termed the &#8220;Association of the Hanse-towns,&#8221;
is better known in history under the name of
&#8220;The Hanseatic League.&#8221; It consisted chiefly of merchants,&mdash;men
who had brought commerce to all the perfection
it was capable of acquiring at that period, which may
justly be termed the dawn of our great commercial history.
It was under this league the banking system, exchanges,
and the principles of book-keeping, with double entries,
and various other practices which facilitate and secure
commercial intercourse, originated. We speak here of the
banking system only. Banks existed long prior to this
date, but in a very different form. Those of the ninth
century were literally &#8220;benches,&#8221; from the custom of the
Italian merchants exposing money to lend on a &#8220;banco,&#8221;
or bench, or tables.</p>

<p>The towns of the &#8220;Hanseatic League&#8221; were originally
a confederacy united in an alliance for the mutual support
and encouragement of their commerce. Perhaps the
world&#8217;s history does not present an example so fraught
with interest to the commercial world than that which
was here furnished. Industry, application, a union of
interests, combined with a general knowledge of trade and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
commerce, the league soon became the wonder of surrounding
nations, who not only imitated its example, but
followed its precepts. It was under its dynasty the postal
system was established and communications of post-routes
opened with all the towns. In proportion as the reputation,
opulence, and forces of the league subsequently
changed to &#8220;The Hanseatic Confederacy&#8221; increased, there
were few towns of note in Europe that were not associated
with it. Thus, France furnished to the confederacy Rouen,
St. Malo, Bordeaux, Bayonne, and Marseilles. Spain:
Cadiz, Barcelona, and Seville. Portugal: Lisbon. Italy
and Sicily: Messina, Leghorn, and Naples. Russia: Novogorod.
Norway: Bergen, &amp;c. Lastly, England furnished
London to this celebrated association, whose warehouses
and factories were the wonder and the admiration of the
commercial world.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> As we have said, it was under this
league the first practical post system was established; and
its legitimate object and purpose was only interfered with
when it became subject to a higher power.</p>

<p>This great commercial league fully sustained the opinion&mdash;at
least entertained at that period&mdash;that &#8220;Commerce
alone is sufficient to insure greatness.&#8221; Subsequent events,
arising out of the political elements of a country, afford
convincing proofs that something more substantial than
commerce is requisite to maintain the independence of any
nation. This, however, is a question which involves that
of the laws of nations and the ethics of political economy.
Mr. Oddy ascribes the downfall of the Hanse Confederacy
to their becoming warlike, and preferring political importance
to wealth obtained by their original modes. It is,
however, probable that no system of policy, either commercial
or political, however wise or moderate, could have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
prevented the wars in which the Hanseatic League were
involved. They stood on the defensive against their hostile
neighbors, whose envy and jealousy were excited by
the showy wealth of these cities. If commerce, therefore,
brought on these wars, and defeated the great object of the
league, it is evident that something more powerful than
commercial sway was necessary to keep it in contact with
the agricultural and political interests of the nation.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The combination of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce
is no doubt the true cause of greatness,&mdash;the opulence
and power of those nations who study the interest
of each alike. It ought therefore to be the policy of the
rulers to guard the progress of these great branches with
the same fostering care and protection,&mdash;to encourage one
without depressing the other; and to watch their reciprocal
bearings, connection, and affinity, that the general interest
may be promoted and the resources consolidated into a
mass of strength adequate or superior to the power of
their enemies. The United States has not lost sight of
this fact; and hence every department of its great interests
is alike defended, protected, and encouraged. We may
have wars; but they will never arise from our neglect of
any one particular branch of the government, or of its
source of revenue.</p>

<p>Perhaps no city in the world presented a greater
display of wealth than did that of Bruges in the year
1301. She was one of the cities of the confederacy.
It contained in that year sixty-eight companies of
traders and artificers, while its citizens rivalled many
of the European monarchs in their sumptuous mode of
living. Some idea of their splendor may be formed from
the following anecdote, recorded by Dr. Robinson in his
&#8220;Historical Disquisitions,&#8221; who relates that, in the year
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
1301, Joanna of Navarre, the wife of Philip the Fair, of
France, having been some days in Bruges, was so much
struck with the splendor of the city and its grandeur, as
well as the rich and costly dresses of the &#8220;citizen&#8217;s wives,&#8221;
that she was moved by female envy to exclaim with indignation,&mdash;&#8220;I
thought that I had been the only queen here;
but I find that there are many hundreds more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Hanse Towns had attained the summit of their
power in 1428; but they began to decline the moment
they became warlike,&mdash;thus neglecting their great commercial
power, wealth, and influence. The rise of Holland
accelerated their decline; and the general attention which
other nations began to pay to manufactures and commerce,
by distributing them more generally and equally amongst
the people in different parts of Europe, destroyed that
superiority which they had so long enjoyed.</p>

<p>The number and variety of the military undertakings
in which the Hanse Towns embarked, contributed more
powerfully, perhaps, than any of the causes above specified
to accelerate their ruin. A general jealousy was raised;
and the kings of France, Spain, and Denmark, and several
States of Italy, forbid their towns to continue members of
the confederacy. Upon this, the Teutonic Hanse Towns
restricted the confederacy to Germany. About the middle
of the seventeenth century the confederacy was almost
wholly confined to the towns of Hamburg, Lubeck, and
Bremen. They retained the appellation of the Hanseatic
Towns, and claimed their former privileges, among which
their postal system was included. Under the appellation
of the Hanse Towns they were recognized at the peace of
Utrecht, in 1715, and at the Definite Treaty of Indemnity,
in 1805,&mdash;almost the last moment of their political existence.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>The first serious blow struck the postal system was that
which it received from the Emperor Maximilian. He
established a post between Austria and Normandy, and,
as a sort of retaliatory measure, made it an espionage over
his subjects through the medium of their correspondence,
and also for the purpose of enriching himself by the
profits of the enterprise. Fortunately, however, for the
cause of justice and of letters, Maximilian died before he
had inflicted this great wrong on the people to any extent.
He died January 12, 1519.</p>

<p>Having brought the reader to this point of our postal
history, it may not be out of place before we reach the
fifteenth century&mdash;when it assumed a very different aspect&mdash;to
give some account of the earlier history of art, pastoral
life, language, writing materials, letters, &amp;c., more or less
connected with our subject.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;There is nothing new under the sun.&#8221; &#8220;There is no new thing,&#8221; says
Solomon, &#8220;under the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>We cannot speak of any thing, either of a useful or
ornamental character, but we invariably cast our eyes over
the ages of the world and trace up, or rather back, to its
earliest period, their very origin. There is scarcely an art
or a science of which we boast now but owes its existence
to the past ages. We have the proofs on their paintings,
their mechanics, their arts, and sciences: these are the
evidences to prove how far they had advanced in knowledge
before the world&#8217;s revolutions cast them back again
to ignorance and gloom. With the downfall of cities&mdash;crumbling
away under the fiat of the Almighty, or swallowed
up by earthquakes&mdash;went the genius of ages; and
from their ruins and the debris of classic temples came
those traces of high art of which no other living evidences
bore witness. The secret went down amid their tottering
ruins, and left to after-ages the simple task of imitating
their monumental sculptured beauties and fresco painting
on the shattered walls of their ruined temples.</p>

<p>Well, then, may we exclaim with Solomon,</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;There is no new thing under the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>George R. Gliddon, in his great work of &#8220;Ancient
Egypt,&#8221; speaking of the state of the arts in the earliest
ages of Egyptian history, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will not the historian deign to notice the prior origin
of every art and science in Egypt a thousand years before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the Pelasgians studded the isles and capes of the Archipelago
with their forts and temples,&mdash;long before Etruscan
civilization had smiled on Italian skies? And shall not the
ethnographer, versed in Egyptian lore, proclaim the fact
that the physiological, craniological, capillary, and cuticular
distinctions of the human race existed on the distribution
of mankind throughout the earth?</p>

<p>&#8220;Philologists, astronomers, chemists, painters, architects,
physicians must return to Egypt to learn the origin of
language and writing; of the calendar and solar motion;
of the art of cutting granite with a <i>copper</i> chisel and
giving elasticity to a <i>copper sword</i>; of making glass with
the variegated hues of the rainbow; of moving single
blocks of polished sienite 900 tons in weight for any distance
by land and water; of building arches, round and
pointed, with masonic precision unsurpassed at the present
day, and antecedent, by 2000 years, to the &#8220;Cloaca Magna&#8221;
of Rome; of sculpturing a Doric column 1000 years
before the Dorians are known in history; of <i>fresco</i> painting
in imperishable colors; and of practical knowledge in
anatomy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every craftsman can behold in Egyptian monuments
the progress of his art 4000 years ago; and, whether it be
a wheelwright building a chariot, a shoemaker drawing
his twine, a leather-cutter using the selfsame form of a
knife of old as is considered the best form now, a weaver
throwing the same hand-shuttle, a whitesmith using that
identical form of blowpipe but lately recognized to be the
most efficient, the seal-engraver cutting in hieroglyphics
such names as Shooph&#8217;s above 4300 years ago, or even
the poulterer removing the <i>pip</i> from geese, all these and
many more astounding evidences of Egyptian priority
now require but a glance at the plates of Rosellini.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps the post-office, being a more modern invention,
the result of man&#8217;s progress, and its use essential to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
present wants and governmental requirements, claims
more originality than many of those inventions which a
ruder state of society devised. And yet even here we
actually owe to those ages much of the material which
makes up our great postal superstructure. We learned
from them how messengers, couriers, and the transmitting
of letters formed an important part of their social system,
and how it ultimately grew into a political one, under
kings and emperors, through all subsequent ages.</p>

and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As the earth became peopled the wants of man called
forth all those energies requisite to sustain life by labor or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
otherwise; and these brought forth the mind&#8217;s attributes
combined, and the world became a mirror reflecting Him
who created it.</p>

<p>Pastoral life, in the early ages of the world&#8217;s history,
afforded in itself the means of providing for the wants of
man. This led to the cultivation of the soil and the raising
of cattle.</p>

<p>Before the flood, Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Jabez
was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.
Then came trades and professions. These led to art, art to
science; and, as their numbers increased, they soon found
that their sources from which they derived their subsistence&mdash;the
spontaneous fruits of the earth and the flesh of
wild animals killed in the chase&mdash;were insufficient to
maintain them. Hence they were obliged to have recourse
to other means. Property being established and ascertained,
men began to exchange one rude commodity for
another. While their wants and desires were confined
within narrow bounds, they had no other idea of traffic
but that of simple barter. The husbandman exchanged a
part of his harvest for the cattle of the shepherd; the
hunter gave the prey which he had caught at the chase for
the honey and the fruits which his neighbor had gathered
in the woods. Thus, commercial intercourse began and
extended throughout the community. It reached still
farther. It passed in its onward career from city to city,
and from kingdom to kingdom, till at last it comprehended
and united the remotest regions of the earth.</p>

<p>Then came trades and professions. These led to art, art
to science, and science to the highest degree of knowledge
the human mind is capable of attaining. Men became
great: greatness led to power,&mdash;power to rule and govern.
The combining of all these elementary steps led to the
creation of kings, emperors, and lords. Then followed
the division of classes. The phases of human intellect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
harmonized the whole system of rule, and men acknowledged
in time the one great axiom, that &#8220;Knowledge is
power.&#8221;</p>

<p>As language, writing, and writing-materials are all,
more or less, connected with any subject identified with
the welfare, the interest, and honor of a nation, as well
as of mankind, they will not be considered out of place
if alluded to here in connection with the subject of this
work. First:&mdash;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LANGUAGE.</i></h3>

<p>Blair, in his introduction to his Lectures on Rhetoric,
speaking of language, says:&mdash;&#8220;One of the most distinguished
privileges which Providence has conferred upon
mankind is the power of communicating their thoughts to
one another. Destitute of this power, reason would be a
solitary and, in some measure, an unavoidable principle.
Speech is the great instrument by which man becomes beneficial
to man; and it is to the intercourse and transmission
of thought, by means of speech, that we are
chiefly indebted for the improvement of thought itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tooke, in one of his admirable golden sentences, says:&mdash;&#8220;The
first aim of language was to communicate our
thoughts; the second, to do it with dispatch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the worlde was of one tongue and one language.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bible</i>,
1551, <i>Gen.</i> xi.</p>

<p>Language came into the world along with all things
that had life. It was the voice of nature speaking through
things animate, giving form and harmony to objects animate
as well as inanimate; and all of which, as soon as
created, God pronounced good.</p>

<p>Flowers had their language, and there was music in the
spheres. Trees murmured through their deep forest-home
long before the woodman&#8217;s axe stripped them of their
mode of expressing their wild &aelig;olian sounds to each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
And there was language in waterfalls, mountain cataracts,
as well as music in the sound, though expressed in
thundertones; and, as the spirit of Deity passed over the
earth, all living things found tongue, thought, expression,
and the human voice syllabled the words and commands
of its Maker. Language, therefore, is a divine institution.</p>

<p>Horace, Pliny, Juvenal, and others, held the opinion
that it was a divine institution, and only reached its present
state after a long and gradual improvement of the
human family.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient philosophers and poets believed
that men were originally &#8220;a dumb, low herd.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;Mutum et turpe pecus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo&mdash;who, in his work on &#8220;the Origin of
Language,&#8221; labors to prove that man is but a higher species
of monkey&mdash;thinks that originally the human race
had only a few monosyllables, such as, &#8220;Ha, he, hi, ho,&#8221;
by which, like beasts, they expressed certain emotions.
Others, again, assert that the early races were in all things
rude and savage, totally ignorant of the arts, unable to
communicate with each other, except in the imperfect
manner of beasts, and sensible of nothing save hunger,
pain, and similar emotions. Cicero, alluding to the human
race in primeval ages, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when men wandered everywhere
through life after the manner of beasts, and supported
themselves by eating the food of beasts. Fields and
mountains, hills and dales were alike their homes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rousseau represents men as originally without language,
as unsocial by nature, and totally ignorant of the ties of
society. He does not, however, seek to explain how language
arose, being disheartened at the outset by the difficulty
of deciding whether language was more necessary for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the institution of society, or society for the invention of
language.</p>

<p>Language is beyond doubt a divine institution, invented
by Deity, and by him made known to the human
race. If language was devised by man, the invention
would not have been at once matured, but must have
been the result of the necessities and experience of successive
generations. Adam and Eve, in the garden of Eden,
spoke a language the purity of which continued until its
final disruption at the building of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>What language is more beautiful and expressive than
that of the Hebrew? It is the language of Deity, and
it pleased our Lord Jesus to make use of it when he spake
from heaven unto Paul.</p>

<p>There are said to be no less than 3425 known languages
in use in the world, of which 937 are Asiatic, 588 European,
276 African, and 1624 American languages and
dialects.</p>

<p>By calculation from the best dictionaries, for each of the
following languages there are about 20,000 words in the
Spanish, 22,000 in the English, 38,000 in the Latin,
30,000 in the French, 45,000 in the Italian, 50,000 in the
Greek, and 80,000 in the German.</p>

<p>In the estimate of the number of words in the English
language it includes, of course, not only the radical words,
but also derivatives, except the preterites and participles
of verbs; to which must be added some few terms which,
though set down in the dictionaries, are either obsolete or
have never ceased to be considered foreign. Of these
about 23,000, or nearly five-eighths, are of Anglo-Saxon
origin.</p>

<p>The alphabets of different nations contain the following
number of letters:&mdash;English, 26; French, 23; Italian,
20; Spanish, 27; German, 26; Sclavonic, 27; Russian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>

Persian, 32; Turkish, 33; Sanscrit, 50; Chinese, 214.</p>

<p>Anthony Brewer (1617) thus characterized those best

<b>Origin of the Materials of Writing, Tablets, etc.</b></h2>

<p>The art of writing is very ancient. Its origin is
actually lost in the distance of time. From one point,
however,&mdash;this side of the gulf of lost ages, in which
high art perished, and with it the key to all its antediluvian
greatness,&mdash;we date our history.</p>

<p>The Bible gives us the earliest notice on the subject that
is anywhere to be found. The most ancient mode of
writing was on <i>cinders</i>, on bricks, and on <i>tables of stone</i>;
afterwards on <i>plates</i> of various materials, on <i>ivory</i> and
similar articles. One of the earliest methods was to cut
out the letters on a tablet of stone. Moses, we are told,
received the two tables of the Covenant on Mount Sinai,
written with the finger of God; and before that, Moses
himself was not ignorant of the use of letters.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> [Exodus
xxiv. 4; xvii. 14.] A learned writer says:&mdash;&#8220;In Genesis
v. 1, &#8216;This is the book of the generations of Adam,&#8217;
reference is made to the book of genealogy; whence it
irresistibly follows that writing must have been in use
among the antediluvian patriarchs; and, under the view
that writing was a divine revelation, the same almighty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
power that, according to the preceding proposition, instructed
Moses, could have equally vouchsafed a similar
inspiration to any patriarch from Adam to Noah. Nor
does it seem consistent with the merciful dispensation
which preserved Noah&#8217;s family through the grand cataclysm,
and had condescended, according to the biblical
record, to teach him those multitudinous arts indispensably
necessary to the construction of a vessel destined to pass
uninjured through the tempests of the Deluge, that the
Almighty, by withholding the art of writing, should have
left the account of antediluvian events to the vicissitudes of
oral tradition, or denied to Noah&#8217;s family the practice of this
art, which, it is maintained, was conceded first to Moses.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is said that &#8220;Moses was learned in all the wisdom of
the Egyptians.&#8221; The five books of Moses carry with
them internal evidence, not of one sole, connected, and
original composition, but of a <i>compilation</i> by an inspired
writer from earlier annals. The genealogical tables and
family records of various tribes that are found embodied
in the Pentateuch, bear the appearance of documents
copied from written archives. We have the authority of
Genesis v. 1 for asserting the existence of a book of genealogies
in the time of Noah; and a city mentioned by
Joshua was named in Hebrew &#8220;Kirjath Sefer,&#8221; &#8220;The City
of Letters.&#8221; It is impossible to prove that letters were
unknown before Moses; and the Hebrews of his day
appear to have had two distinct modes of writing the
characters of which, in one case, were &#8220;<i>alphabetic</i>,&#8221; and in
the other &#8220;<i>symbolic</i>.&#8221; The inscription on the ephod itself
is said&mdash;Exodus xxviii. 36&mdash;to have been written in characters
&#8220;like the engravings of a signet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The materials and instruments with which writing
was performed were, in comparison with our pen, ink,
and paper, extremely rude and unwieldy. One of the
earliest methods was to cut out the letters on a tablet of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
stone. Another was to trace them on unbaked tiles, or
bricks, which were afterwards thoroughly baked or burned
with fire. When the writing was wanted to be more
durable, lead or brass was employed. In the book of Job,
mention is made of writing on stone. It was on tablets
of stone that Moses received the law written by the finger
of God himself. Tablets of wood were frequently used
as being more convenient. Such was the writing-table
which Zacharias used. [Luke i. 63.] Cedar was preferred
as being more incorruptible; from this custom
arose the celebrated saying of the ancients, when they
meant to give the highest eulogium of an excellent work,
<i>et cedro digna locuti</i>,&mdash;that it was worthy to be written on
cedar. These tablets were made of the trunks of trees.
The same reason which led them to prefer the cedar to
other trees, induced them to write on wax, which is incorruptible.
Men used it to write their testaments, in order
better to preserve them. Thus, Juvenal says, <i>cereus implere
capaces</i>. The leaves and, at other times, the bark of
different trees were early used for writing. From the
thin films of bark peeled off from the Egyptian reed
papyrus which grew along the Nile, a material was formed
in latter times answering the purpose much better. It
bore the name of the reed, papyrus, or, in our language,
paper. Long afterwards its name passed to a different
material, composed of linen or cotton, which has taken
place of all others in the use of civilized countries, and is
called to this day paper. Paper made of cotton was in
use in 1001; that of linen rags in 1319.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the
brooks, ... shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.</i>&#8221;&mdash;Isaiah
xix. 7.</p>

<p>Pliny, speaking of the papyrus, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we depart out of Egypt, we must not forget
the plant <i>papyrus</i>, but describe the nature thereof, considering
that all civilitie of life, the memoriall, and immortalitie
also of men after death consisteth especially in
<i>paper</i> which is made thereof. M. Varro writeth that the
first invention of making paper was devised upon the
conquest of &AElig;gypt, achieved by Alexander the Great, at
what time as he founded the city of Alexandria in &AElig;gypt,
where such paper was first made.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Holland</i>, <i>Plinie</i>, b.
xiii. c. 21.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the barks of trees being used. The
thin peel which is found between the second skin of a tree
was called <i>liber</i>,&mdash;from whence the Latin word, <i>liber</i>, a
book; and we have derived the name of library and librarian
in the European language, and in the French their
<i>livre</i> for book.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE PEN.</i></h3>

<p>The instruments employed by the ancients for making
the letters on their tablets was a small, pointed piece of
iron, or some other hard substance, called by the Romans
a <i>style</i>: hence a man&#8217;s manner of composition was figuratively
called his <i>style</i> of writing. The use of the word
still continues, though the instrument has long since passed
away.</p>

<p>Style derives its name from <i>stylus</i>, Latin, as also from a
Greek word, <i>columna</i>, an instrument with a point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Reeds formed into pens were used to trace the letters
with ink of some sort after the fashion that is now common;
or else they were painted with a small brush, as
was probably the general custom at first. Pens made of
quills were not in use until the fifth century. The oldest
certain account of writing with quills is a passage of Isidore,
who died in 636, and who, among the instruments
of writing, mentions &#8220;reeds and feathers.&#8221; In the same
century a small poem was written on a pen, which is to
be found in the works of Althelmus. He died in 709.</p>

<p>We annex the following as giving a poetical original of
the pen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;Love begg&#8217;d and pray&#8217;d old Time to stay</div>

<div class="line i0">A pen&#8217;s the only plume I know</div>
<div class="line i1">That wings her pace for absent lovers.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>PENCILS.</i></h3>

<p>The ancients drew their lines with leaden styles; afterwards
a mixture of tin and lead fused together was used.
The mineral known under the name of plumbago is supposed
to have been first employed for the purpose of
drawing in the fifteenth century. In 1565, an old author
notes that people had pencils for writing which consisted
of a wooden handle, in which was a piece of lead; and a
drawing is given of the pencil as an object of curiosity.
They continued to be uncommon for upwards of a century,
when we hear them spoken of being enclosed in pine or
cedar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE SCRIBE.</i></h3>

<p class="small">&#8220;Scribe was a name which, among the Jews, was applied to two sorts of
officers. 1. To a civil: and so it signifies a notary, or, in a large sense, any
one employed to draw up deeds and writings. 2. This name signifies a
church officer, one skillful and conversant in the law to interpret and explain
it.&#8221;&mdash;<i>South.</i> vol. iv. ser. 1.</p>

<p>The word <i>scribe</i> is derived from the Latin, <i>scribere</i>,
which has the same meaning as &#8220;schrabben&#8221; (Dutch), to
scrape or draw a style, or pen, over the surface of paper
or parchment.</p>

<p>The name, however, was given to such as excelled in
the use of the pen, and who were likewise distinguished
in other branches of knowledge. It came in time to mean
simply a learned man; and, as the chief part of learning
among the Jews was concerned with the sacred books of
Scripture, the word signified especially one &#8220;who was
<i>skilled in the law of God</i>&#8221;&mdash;one whose business it was, not
merely to provide correct copies of its volume, but also to
explain its meaning. Thus, Ezra is called &#8220;a ready scribe
of the law of Moses.&#8221;&mdash;Ezra vii. 6.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of types, books were written
generally upon skins, linen, cotton-cloth, or papyrus:
parchment in later times was most esteemed. The business
of the scribes was to make duplicate copies of these
books, which, when completed, the leaves were pinned
together so as to make a single long sheet. This was then
rolled round a stick: hence books of every description
or size were called &#8220;rolls;&#8221; our word volume means just
the same thing in its original signification.</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;<i>Volumed in rolling masses.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the time of our Saviour the scribes formed quite a
considerable class in society. Many of them belonged to
the sanhedrim, or chief council, and are therefore frequently
mentioned in the New Testament with the elders
and chief priests.&mdash;See Luke v. 17, x. 25; Matthew xxiii.
2; Matthew ii. 4, also xiii. 52; and Mark xii. 35.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ANCIENT INK.</i></h3>

<p>The ink used by the ancients appears to have been what
is termed in art a &#8220;body color,&#8221; or a more solid medium
than is at present used, and similar to what is used by the
modern Chinese.</p>

<p>Subsequently, lamp-black, or the black taken from
burnt ivory, and soot from furnaces and baths, according
to Pliny and others, formed the basis of the ink used by
old writers.</p>

<p>It has also been conjectured that the black liquor of the
scuttle-fish was frequently employed.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Of whatever ingredients
it was made, it is certain, from chemical analysis,
from the blackness and solidity in the most ancient manuscripts,
and from inkstands found at Herculaneum, in
which the ink appears like thick oil, that the ink then
made was much more opaque, as well as encaustic, than
what is used at present. Inks red, purple, and blue, and
also gold and silver inks were much used; the red was
made from vermilion, cinnabar, and carmine; the purple
from the <i>murex</i>, one sort of which, named the purple
encaustic, was set apart for the sole use of the emperors.
Golden ink was used by the Greeks much more than by
the Romans. The manufacture of both gold and silver
ink was an extensive and lucrative business in the Middle
Ages. Another distinct business was that of inscribing
the titles, capitals, as well as emphatic words, in colored
and gold and silver inks.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>INK-HORNS.</i></h3>

<p>The ink-horns were sometimes made of lead, sometimes
of silver, and were generally polygonal in their form.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>HIEROGLYPHICAL WRITING.</i></h3>

<p>The remote antiquity of hieroglyphical writing may be
inferred from the fact that it must have existed before the
use of the <i>solar</i> month in Egypt,&mdash;&#8220;which,&#8221; says Gliddon,
&#8220;astronomical observations on Egyptian records prove to
have been in use at an epoch close up to the Septuagint
era of the Flood.&#8221; From Egyptian annals we may glean
some faint confirmation of the view that they either possessed
the <i>primeval</i> alphabet, or else they rediscovered its
equivalent from the mystic functions and attributes of the
&#8220;two Thoths,&#8221;&mdash;the first and second Hermes, both Egyptian
mythological personages, deified as attributes of the
Godhead.</p>

<p>To &#8220;Thoth,&#8221; Mercury, or the first Hermes, the Egyptians
ascribed the invention of <i>letters</i>.</p>

<p>The first attempts of &#8220;picture-writing&#8221; were to imitate
certain images, each representing a word or letter. Drawing,
therefore, was the most natural medium; and the
study of representing things pictorially became popular
and the only mode of communication.</p>

<p>The true origin of alphabetical writing has never
been traced; but that of the Egyptians has been proved
by the Comte de Caylus to be formed, as stated above,
of hieroglyphical marks, adopted with no great variations.
&#8220;We find,&#8221; says Warburton, &#8220;no appearance of alphabetical
writing or characters on their public monuments.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, however true at the time he wrote, cannot now be
asserted; since the celebrated Rosetta stone, in the British
Museum, is engraved with three distinct sets of characters,&mdash;Greek,
Egyptian, and a third resembling what are called
hieroglyphics. The only doubt that can be entertained
is, whether these are strictly hieroglyphics,&mdash;that is, representations
of things,&mdash;or rather an alphabetical character
peculiar to the priesthood, and called hierogrammatics.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
1. The existence of this sacred alphabet is
attested by Herodotus, Diodorus, and several other
writers. 2. It went occasionally under the name of hieroglyphic,
as appears not only by the passage quoted
above from Manetho, if we do not alter the text, but
from one in Porphyry, which may be found in Warburton.
3. It was, however, considered as perfectly distinct
from the genuine hieroglyphic, which was always understood
to denote things, either by mere picture-writing,
or, more commonly, by very refined allegory. 4. Works
of a popular and civil nature were written in this character,
as we learn from Clement of Alexandria; whereas
the genuine hieroglyphic was exceedingly secret and mysterious,
and the knowledge of it confined to the priesthood.
5. The inscription upon the Rosetta stone is said,
in the terms of the decree contained in it, to be written in
the sacred, national, and Greek characters. 6. It could
not be a mysterious character, such as the genuine hieroglyphic
seems to have been, because it was exposed to
public view with a double translation. 7. It occupies a
considerable space upon the stone, although an indefinite
part of it is broken off; although the real hieroglyphic,
as is natural to emblematic writing, appears to have
been exceedingly compendious. 8. The characters do not
appear to be very numerous, as they recur in various
combinations of three, four, or more, as might be expected
from the letters of an alphabet. But this argument we do
not strongly press, because our examination has not been
very long. It appears to hold out a decisive test, and we
offer it as such to the ingenuity of antiquaries.</p>

<p>Upon these grounds we think that the characters upon
the Rosetta stone, which are commonly denominated hieroglyphics,
are in fact the original alphabetic characters
of the Egyptians, from which the others have probably
been derived by a gradual corruption through haste in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
writing. They are, however, in one sense, hieroglyphics,
being tolerably accurate delineations of men, animals, and
instruments. If we are right in our conjectures, the
value of the Rosetta stone is incomparably greater than
has been imagined. We have no need of hieroglyphics:
Roman and Egyptian monuments are full of them. But
a primitive alphabet, probably the earliest ever formed in
the world, and illustrating an important link in the
history of writing,&mdash;the adaptation of signs to words,&mdash;is
certainly a discovery very interesting to any philosophical
mind. Through what steps the analysis of articulate
sound into its constituent parts was completed&mdash;if
we can say that it ever has been completed&mdash;so as to establish
distinct marks for each of them, and whether these
marks were taken at random, or from some supposed analogy
between the simple sounds they were brought to represent
and their primary hieroglyphical meaning, are questions
which stand in need of solution.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The Rosetta stone is the only one yet discovered, being
no doubt the <i>pioneer</i> to many more that may yet be unearthed.
The importance of this stone&mdash;its inscription
indicating the probability of its supplying a key to the
deciphering of the long-lost meanings of Egyptian hieroglyphics&mdash;&#8220;was
immediately,&#8221; says Gliddon, in his Lectures
on Ancient Egypt, &#8220;perceived by the learned, who in
vain endeavored to trace the analogy between symbolical
and alphabetical writing. Its arrival in London excited
the liveliest interest in all those who had devoted themselves
to Egyptian arch&aelig;ology; and the attention of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
greatest scholars of the age was directed to its critical investigation.&#8221;
(See Gliddon&#8217;s work on Ancient Egypt.)</p>

<p>Any one who will examine the hieroglyphical alphabet
closely will discover a most extraordinary coincidence in
that of the symbolical writing of our North American
Indians, specimens of which are in the museum at Washington
City. A war despatch, giving an account of one
of their expeditions, has the same emblematical figures as
has that of the Egyptians as used 1550 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>There are also among other tribes many remarkable
similarities, and analogous with Egyptian symbolical
writings, which strengthen the supposition that the Indians
of North America are one of the lost tribes of Israel. Nor
is it alone the mere words which these signs and figures
convey, but certain traits of character in their habits and
customs as compared with the ancients.&mdash;(See Isaiah xi.
11-15.)</p>

<p>The Indians have a tradition among them to this effect:
&#8220;<i>that nine parts of their nation out of ten passed over a
great river</i>.&#8221; They also have traditions of the &#8220;Flood,&#8221;
&#8220;a good book,&#8221; &#8220;Tower of Babel,&#8221; &#8220;dispersion of the
Jews,&#8221; and the &#8220;confounding of language.&#8221; It is related
by Father Charlevoix, the French historian, that the
Hurons and Iroquois in their early day had a tradition
among them that the first woman came from heaven and
had twins, and that the elder killed the younger. In
1641 an old Indian woman stated that this tradition
among her tribe was that the Great Spirit had killed
his brother. This is evidently a confusion of the story
of Cain and Abel. Still, the tradition is remarkable
from the fact that this, as well as the others alluded to,
existed long before the discovery of this continent.</p>

<p>The Ottawas say that there are two great beings
who rule and govern the universe, and who are at war
with each other. The one they call &#8220;<i>Mameto</i>,&#8221; the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
&#8220;Matchemaneto.&#8221; There is a wonderful, or rather, we
should say, a remarkable, resemblance between the language
of the Creek Indians with that of the ancient
Hebrew; for instance: &#8220;Y He Howa&#8221; means Jehovah;
&#8220;Halleluwah,&#8221; hallelujah; &#8220;Abba,&#8221; in Creek, has the
same meaning as &#8220;Abba&#8221; in Hebrew; &#8220;Kesh,&#8221; kesh;
&#8220;Abe,&#8221; Abel; &#8220;Kenaaj,&#8221; Canaan; &#8220;Awah,&#8221; Eve, or
Eweh; &#8220;Korah,&#8221; Cora; &#8220;Jennois,&#8221; Jannon, both literally
meaning, &#8220;He shall be called a son.&#8221; There is more in
these similarities than can be attributed to mere chance.</p>

<p>Any one at all familiar with hieroglyphical writing
need only to examine the Indian characters upon buffalo
and other skins received in trade from the Indians to
trace, as it were, a distinct line from that most ancient
school of designing figures to suit expression and language,
down to these tribes, who may well be called the
descendants of the &#8220;remnant of&#8221; God&#8217;s people, who were
scattered over the lands of Egypt and the &#8220;islands of the
sea,&#8221; in the time of Isaiah.</p>

<p>In the Ambrosian Library at Milan there are to be
seen Mexican hieroglyphics, painted in Mexico upon
buck-leather, and were presented to the Emperor Charles
V. by Ferdinand Cortez. These hieroglyphics are now
as little understood as are those of Egypt, although both are
now gradually yielding to the mind&#8217;s influence in their
development. Impressions of these were taken on copper
from fac-similes in the possession of Humboldt.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first real step made into the hieroglyphical
arcana may be dated from 1797, when the learned Dane,
George Zoega, published at Rome his folio &#8220;De Origine
et Usa Obeliscorum,&#8221; explanatory of the Egyptian
Obelisks.&mdash;(<i>G. R. Gliddon.</i>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES&mdash;THE CONFOUNDING
OF LANGUAGES.</i></h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable passages in Holy Writ
is that which speaks of the confounding of language.
&#8220;And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they
have all one language. Let us go down, and there confound
their language, that they may not understand one
another&#8217;s speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from
thence upon the face of the earth, and they left off to build
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name of it was called &#8220;Babel&#8221; (confusion), from the
Hebrew. The consequence of this eternal fiat, which went
forth like a flash of lightning, was, that the people became
as strangers to each other, and spoke a language wild and
chaotic. Gesticulation took the place of words; and hence
their punishment for daring to contest power with their
Creator.</p>

<p>The building of the Tower of Babel was an act of
Nimrod&#8217;s, who &#8220;esteemed it a piece of cowardice to submit
to God;&#8221; and he urged the people on to build this
tower, saying, <i>He would be revenged on God</i> if he should
ever have a mind to drown the world again; for that he
would build it so high the waters could not reach it. The
place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon.
From this date may be ascribed the history of languages.
It is supposed, however, that Noah and other pious persons,
chiefly the descendants of Shem in the line of Eber,
not being concerned in this project, retained the <i>original</i>
language. Now, if this was, as it is highly probable, the
Hebrew, we may conclude it was thus called from Eber,
to whose descendants it was peculiar; and perhaps this is
the most satisfactory reason that can be assigned why
Abraham is called the Hebrew and his posterity Hebrews.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the mere confusion of tongues<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
which rendered the people incapable of conversing one
with another, but it was the extraordinary miracle connected
with it of the <i>mind&#8217;s confusion</i>. Incapable, therefore,
of bringing their original language back to its former
use, they invented new languages, new phrases; and thus
in time every great nation had its own language. The
dividing of languages was therefore the dividing of
nations. The precise number of original languages then
heard for the first time cannot be determined. The
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Teutonic, Sclavonian, Tartarian,
and Chinese languages are considered to be original: the
rest are only dialects from them.</p>

<p>History is silent on the early data of the building of the
Tower of Babel; nor is one of its builders&#8217; names mentioned,
except the somewhat obscure intimation respecting
Nimrod.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Babylon subsequently became the head-quarters of
idolatry, and the type of the &#8220;mystical Babylon,&#8221; the
mother of harlots and abominations of the earth.</p>

<p>The glory of Babylon departed. Its walls of sixty miles
in circumference, eighty-seven feet thick and three hundred
and fifty feet high, built of brick and containing
twenty-five gates of solid brass and two hundred and fifty
towers, are now the wonder of men who gaze upon the
<i>debris</i> of &#8220;splendor in ruins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruins of &#8220;Birs Nimrod,&#8221; on an elevated mount,
are supposed to be the Tower of Babel of the sacred Scriptures,
and the temple of Belus, so minutely described by
Herodotus. The base of this tower measures two thousand
and eighty-two feet in circumference. Babylon was in its
glory in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. It was besieged
and taken by Cyrus <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 538, and afterwards by Alexander
the Great.</p>

<div class="line i15"><span class="smcap">Chaucer.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are so many beautiful passages both in sacred
and profane history alluding to messengers, in connection
with our subject, that there is no doubt but as civilization
progressed the word and its meaning laid the foundation
for the many improvements which are to be found in our
present postal system,&mdash;a system which now connects all
nations together by a <i>letter-line mode</i> of communication.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful passage in Holy Writ from which,
figuratively, we date the origin of <i>first carrier or messenger</i>:
it is that of the dove that went forth from the
ark. &#8220;And the dove came in to him in the evening, and,
lo, in her mouth <i>was</i> an olive leaf plucked off: so Noah
knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE RETURN OF THE DOVE.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;There was hope in the ark at the dawning of day,</div>
<div class="line i0">When o&#8217;er the wide waters the dove flew away;</div>

<div class="line i15"><span class="smcap">Mackay.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The name of messenger is derived from the Latin word
<i>missaticum</i>, and this from <i>missus</i>, one sent. The old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
French <i>mes</i> was applied both to the <i>message</i> and the
<i>messager</i>.</p>

<div class="line i15"><span class="smcap">Spenser.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Gower, the poet of the fourteenth century, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;<i>The raynbow is hir messagere.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Angels are called &#8220;winged messengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The angels are still dispatched by God upon all his
great <i>messages</i> to the world, and, therefore, their very
name in Greek signifies a <i>messenger</i>.&#8221;&mdash;<i>South</i>, vol. viii.
ser. 3.</p>

<p>Milton also thus beautifully alludes to the angel messengers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i9">&#8220;For will deign</div>

<div class="line i0">Thither will send her winged <i>messengers</i></div>
<div class="line i0">On errands of supernal grace.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Carriers, in connection with letters, are modern appendages
to the post-office, and now form one of its most important
branches. They are indeed welcome messengers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very carrier that comes from him to her is a most
welcome guest; and if he bring a letter she will read it
twenty times over.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Burton.</i></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE CARRIER-PIGEON.</i></h3>

<p>The first mention we find made of the employment of
pigeons as letter-carriers is by Ovid, in his &#8220;Metamorphoses,&#8221;
who tells us that Taurosthenes, by a pigeon stained
with purple, gave notice of his having been victor at the
Olympic Games on the very same day to his father at
&AElig;gina.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Goldsmith, in his &#8220;Animated Nature,&#8221; says:&mdash;&#8220;It is
from their attachment to their native place, and particularly
where they have brought up their young, that these
birds (pigeons) are employed in several countries as the
most expeditious carriers.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the city of Ptolemais, in Syria, was invested by
the French and Venetians, and it was ready to fall into
their hands, they observed a pigeon flying over them, and
immediately conjectured that it was charged with letters
to the garrison. On this the whole army raising a loud
shout, so confounded the poor aerial post that it fell to the
ground; and, on being seized, a letter was found under its
wings from its Sultan, in which he assured the garrison
that &#8220;he would be with them in three days with an army
sufficient to raise the siege.&#8221; For this letter the besiegers
substituted another to this purpose: &#8220;that the garrison
must see to their own safety; for the Sultan had such other
affairs pressing him it was impossible for him to come to
their succor;&#8221; and with this false intelligence they let the
pigeon flee on his course. The garrison, deprived by this
decree of all hopes of relief, immediately surrendered. The
Sultan appeared on the third day, as promised, with a
powerful army, and was not a little mortified to find the
city already in the hands of the Christians.</p>

<p>In the East the employment of pigeons in the conveyance
of letters is still very common, particularly in Syria,
Arabia, and Egypt. Every bashaw has generally a basketful
of them sent him from the grand seraglio, where they
are bred, and, in case of any insurrection or other emergency,
he is enabled, by letting loose two or more of these extraordinary
messengers, to convey intelligence to the government
long before it could be possibly obtained by other
means.</p>

<p>The diligence and speed with which these feathered
messengers wing their course is extraordinary. From the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
instant of their liberation their flight is directed through
the clouds at an immense height to the place of their destination.
They are believed to dart onward in a straight
line, and never descend except when at a loss for breath;
and then they are to be seen commonly at dawn of day
lying on their backs on the ground, with their bills open,
sucking with hasty avidity the dew of the morning. Of
their speed the instances related are almost incredible.</p>

<p>The Consul of Alexandria daily sends despatches by
these means to Aleppo in five hours, though couriers
occupy the whole day, and proceed with the utmost expedition
from one town to the other.</p>

<p>Some years ago a gentleman sent a carrier-pigeon from
London, by the stage-coach, to his friend in St. Edmundsbury,
together with a note desiring that the pigeon, two
days after their arrival there, might be thrown up precisely
when the town-clock struck nine in the morning. This
was done accordingly, and the pigeon arrived in London
and flew to the Bull Inn, Bishopsgate Street, into the
loft, and was there shown at half an hour past eleven
o&#8217;clock, having flown seventy-two miles in two hours and
a half.</p>

<p>Carrier pigeons were again employed, but with better
success, at the siege of Leyden, in 1675. The garrison
were, by means of the information thus conveyed to them,
induced to stand out till the enemy, despairing of reducing
the place, withdrew. On the siege being raised, the Prince
of Orange ordered that the pigeons which had rendered
such essential service should be maintained at the public
expense, and at their death they should be embalmed and
preserved in the town-house as a perpetual token of gratitude.</p>

<p>At Antwerp, in 1819, one of the thirty-two pigeons
belonging to that city, which had been conveyed to London
and there let loose, made the transit back&mdash;being a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
distance in a direct line of one hundred and eighty miles&mdash;in
six hours.</p>

<p>It is through the attachment of the animals to the place
of their birth, and particularly to the spot where they
had brought up their young, that they are thus rendered
useful to mankind.</p>

<p>When a young one flies very hard at home, and is come
to its full strength, it is carried in a basket or otherwise
about half a mile from home and there turned out; after
this it is carried a mile, two, four, eight, ten, twenty, &amp;c.,
till at length it will return from the furthermost parts of
the country.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LETTERS.</i></h3>

<p>The word <i>letter</i> is derived from the Latin &#8220;<i>litera</i>,&#8221; of
which Vossius has not decided its etymology,&mdash;perhaps,
from <i>litum</i>, past participle of <i>linere</i>, to smear, as one of
the oldest modes of writing was by graving the characters
upon tablets smeared over or covered with wax. From
this word comes that of <i>letters</i>; and, as they are more immediately
connected with our subject, we incline to the
opinion of Pliny that the word <i>linere</i>, to smear, is by far
the most truthful definition. In this respect&mdash;that of
&#8220;smearing&#8221;&mdash;it has lost nothing of its original character,
if we were to judge from the appearance of many letters
daily passing through the post-office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smeared o&#8217;er with wax&#8221; would not cause any great
surprise to a modern post-office clerk if a letter presented
itself with this only on it; but when in addition he could
scarcely read the name through the mists of blotted ink and
bad spelling, we venture to say he would endorse Pliny&#8217;s
opinion, above that of all others, without the least hesitation.</p>

<p>An Oriental scholar, speaking upon the subject of writing
as connected with the ancients, makes use of this language:&mdash;&#8220;The
origin of the art of writing loses itself among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
nebulous periods of man&#8217;s primeval history. With the
original ethnographic varieties of the human species, the
primitive distribution of mankind, the patriarchal fountains
of a once-pure religion, and the earliest sources of
the diversity of language, must be associated the first developments
of this art which, from the remotest periods, has
enabled man to record his history, and to overcome space
and time in the transmission of his thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Symbolical or hieroglyphic writing is also very ancient.
It was the ancient style of writing among the Egyptians.
They were also termed &#8220;sacred sculptured characters,&#8221;
which was the original or, rather, monumental method.
The hieratic or sacerdotal was used by the scribes and
priests in literary pursuits prior to 1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>There is a beautiful conceit of Lord Bacon&#8217;s,&mdash;&#8220;<i>Liter&aelig;
Vocales</i>&#8221; (vocal letters), the designation given by that philosopher
to the popular lawyers of the House of Commons
in the reign of James I., meaning those lawyers who were
bold enough to speak their minds and to stand up for the
rights of their constituents.</p>

<p>Words, however, will pass away and be forgotten; but
that which is committed to writing will remain as evidence;
for then you have them in &#8220;black and white.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;Litera scripta manet.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE FIRST LETTER-WRITERS.</i></h3>

<p>Jezebel, it seems, was the first&mdash;or, at least, we believe
the first&mdash;that is mentioned in the Bible as a letter-writer:
&#8220;So she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, and sealed them
with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to
the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.&#8221;&mdash;1
Kings xxi. 8.</p>

<p>For fear a wrong construction should be put upon this
act of Jezebel, and the cause of letters affected thereby, it
may be well to state that she was allowed to do so by him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and that his name and seal were to be used as she pleased.
She, however, used both for a bad purpose: hence the
name of Jezebel is synonymous with deceit and treachery.</p>

<p>Letter-writing is also alluded to in Nehemiah ii. 7:
&#8220;Moreover I said unto, the king, If it please the king, let
<i>letters</i> be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
they may convey me over till I come into Judah.&#8221; Also,
in Esther i. 22: &#8220;For he sent letters into all the king&#8217;s
provinces, into every province according to the writing
thereof, and to every people after their language, that every
man should bear rule in his own house; and that it should
be published according to the language of every people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hiram, King of Tyre, when he heard that Solomon
succeeded to his father&#8217;s kingdom, was very glad of it; for
he was a friend of David&#8217;s . So he sent ambassadors to
him, and saluted him, and congratulated him on the present
happy state of his affairs. Upon which, Solomon
sent an epistle, the contents of which here follow:&mdash;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SOLOMON TO KING HIRAM.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Know thou that my father would have built a temple
to God, but was hindered by wars and continual expeditions;
for he did not leave off to overthrow his enemies
till he made them all subject to tribute. But I give
thanks to God for the peace I at present enjoy, and on
that account I am at leisure and design to build a house
to God; for God foretold to my father that such a house
should be built by me. Wherefore I desire thee to send
some of thy subjects with mine to Mount Lebanon, to
cut down timber; for the Sidonians are more skillful than
our people in cutting of wood. As for wages to the
hewers of wood, I will pay whatsoever thou shalt determine.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Hiram had read this epistle he was pleased with
it, and wrote back this answer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>HIRAM TO KING SOLOMON.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;It is fit to bless God that he hath committed thy father&#8217;s
government to thee, who art a wise man and endowed
with all virtues. As for myself, I rejoice at the condition
thou art in, and will be subservient to thee in all
that thou sendest to me about; for when by my subjects
I have cut down many trees of cedar and cypress wood,
I will send them to sea, and will order my subjects to make
floats of them, and to sail to what place soever of thy
country thou shalt desire, and leave them there; after
which, thy subjects may carry them to Jerusalem. But
do thou take care to procure us corn for this timber, which
we stand in need of because we inhabit an island.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Josephus says:&mdash;&#8220;The copies of these epistles remain at
this day, and are preserved not only in our books, but
among the Tyrians also.&#8221; They were at that period
among the records in the city of Tyre. Other epistles are
also there recorded, among which were those written by
Xerxes, King of the Persians, to Ezra; Artaxerxes to the
Government of Judea; Antiochus the Great to Ptolemy
Epiphanes; and of the Samaritans to Antiochus, Alexander
Balas to Jonathan, Onias to Ptolemy and Cleopatra,
and many others.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<b>Post-Offices&mdash;England.</b></h2>

<p>The history of the English post-office affords but little
interest to the general reader beyond that which its statistics
and geographical calculations afford. It is, however, a
history that goes hand in hand with its trade and commerce;
and whatever improvements have been made upon its past
history are owing altogether to the enterprise of those who
are identified with those branches of the world&#8217;s great
business.</p>

<p>It is not the statesman or the politician who originates,
but the mechanic, the farmer, and the merchant. The
former are the aristocrats of society; the latter, the workers&mdash;the
very bone and sinew of a government.</p>

<p>It is to the farmer, the artisan, and the merchant that
art and science are indebted to their position among the
most brilliant things of earth. It is to them that commerce
owes wings to fly to the remotest parts of the civilized
world, laden with the handiwork of art and the
richness of a nation&#8217;s growth. Society becomes more dignified,
man more ennobled. It is to this power that kings,
emperors, and lords owe their positions; for one word
from that class will bring the loftiest head to the block,
if by word or action the attempt should be made to lessen
or destroy that power which elevated him or them to
eminence.</p>

<p>The commercial power of England is its rule, and to it
that nation owes all its present greatness. The politics of
England is its disgrace; its commerce, its honor. The
king and Parliament are at the head of the one,&mdash;the
hewers of wood and drawers of water at that of the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>We have already alluded to the postal system organized
by the Emperor Charlemagne in the year 807. Yet in
China posts had existed from the earliest times. These
were called <i>Jambs</i>, and were established at a distance from
each other of twenty-five miles. This mode of conveying
letters was by horses; and it is stated by Marco Polo, the
Venetian traveller, that there were frequently as many as
three or four hundred horses in waiting at one of these
places. He also states that there were ten thousand stations
of this kind in China, some of them affording sumptuous
accommodation to travellers. Two hundred thousand
horses are said to have been engaged in the service.</p>

<p>Louis XI. first established post-houses in France.
Post-horses and stages were first introduced into England
in 1483.</p>

<p>The mounted posts in France were stationed at distances
of four miles apart, and were required to be
ready day and night to carry government messages as rapidly
as possible. Private correspondence, however, was
carried on very differently. The students of a university
in Paris established a postal institution in the eleventh
century. A number of pedestrian messengers were employed,
who bore letters from its thousands of students to
the various countries of Europe from which they came,
and brought to them the money they needed for the prosecution
of their studies.</p>

<p>The great development of commerce following the Crusades,
and the geographical discoveries of the Italians,
Portuguese, and Spaniards, created a necessity for a more
extended business-correspondence about the beginning of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In Peru, in 1527, the Spanish invaders found a regular
system of posts in operation along the great highway from
Quito to Cuzco, and messages as to the progress of the
invasion, as well as on other subjects, were forwarded to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Inca by fleet-footed runners, who wound around their
waists the <i>quipu</i>, a species of sign-writing, by means of
knotted cord.</p>

<p>In Sierra Leone they have what is termed the &#8220;Kaffir
letter-carrier,&#8221; who immediately on the arrival of a vessel
takes charge of the letters; and, although it should be
late at night, he starts on his mission into the settlement,
and actually arouses the sleepers with his cry of, &#8220;Ah,
massa, here de right book come at last!&#8221; The Kaffir carries
his letters in a split stick, which he thrusts under your
very nose as he approaches with his welcome document.
He is one of those rare letter-carriers who never tires, nor
complains of making too many trips a day.</p>

<p>The regular riding-post system owes its origin to Edward
IV. This answered not only the demands of the
government, but those of merchants, traders, and others.
The former had, however, what were termed &#8220;government
messengers,&#8221; whose business was more particularly
to summon the barons, sheriffs, and other officers. Heralds
are not to be confounded with these messengers, as they
were more identified with the military than with the civil
power.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry I. messengers were first permanently
employed by the king</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;Messengers he sent throughout England.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the reign of King John, messengers were called the
&#8220;nuncii:&#8221; subsequently they became attached to the royal
palace, and wore the king&#8217;s livery, as in the reign of
Henry III. Several private letters are in existence,
dating as far back as the reign of Edward II., which bear
the appearance of having been carried by the nuncii of
that period, with &#8220;Haste, poste, haste!&#8221; written on the
back.</p>

<p>Little or no improvement was made in England in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
postal system until about the end of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
reign. Even then it simply corrected some of the abuses
of the old system, by establishing what was called &#8220;Master
of the Postes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the limited character of
this department of her majesty&#8217;s service, when we state
that before her death the expenses of the post did not exceed
&pound;5000 per annum. Previous to this estimate, however,
the expenses were considerably larger, owing to the
careless manner, as well as the extravagance, of those having
charge of it.</p>

<p>The reign of Elizabeth was more distinguished for its
number of great men in the world of letters than for almost
any other characteristic feature. The names of these have
been handed down to us, identified with literature in all its
various branches,&mdash;statesmen, warriors, divines, scholars,
poets, and philosophers. Among them we find the names
of Raleigh, Drake, Coke, Hooker, and others of higher
sounding and more frequently quoted,&mdash;Shakspeare, Sidney,
Bacon, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher,&mdash;men &#8220;whose
fame has been eternized in her long and lasting scroll, and
who by their words and acts were benefactors of their
country and ornaments of human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although an age of letters, the commercial interest was
not neglected. Still, that attention was not paid to the
merchant&#8217;s demands for new laws and regulations which
the increasing business demanded: hence there arose a difficulty
in the postal system, which was more immediately
identified with their interests.</p>

<p>In the early part of the queen&#8217;s reign, disputes were frequent
with the foreign merchants resident in London, with
regard to the foreign post, which up to this reign they
had been allowed to manage among themselves. In 1558,
the queen&#8217;s council of state issued a proclamation &#8220;for
the redress of disorders in postes which conveye and bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
to and out of the parts beyond the seas, pacquets of letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>This system&mdash;a system which the very spirit of trade
should rise up against&mdash;was done away with, and the sole
authority was given to the &#8220;Master of the Postes,&#8221; who,
therefore, took charge of the foreign office. The title of
his office was changed, in consequence, to that of &#8220;Chief
Postmaster.&#8221; Thomas Randolph was the first Chief Postmaster
in England.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that during all these periods
of English history the &#8220;common people&#8221; held little or no
communication with each other: hence their correspondence
was very limited. Few of them could read or write.
Palmers, nay, even wandering gipsies, were not unfrequently
the &#8220;common people&#8217;s&#8221; post. The former, particularly,
were trusted with letters and packets for the &#8220;gentry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the Stuarts a regular system of post was established,
the benefits of which were to be shared by all who
could find the means. Even then England was behind
the other European nations in establishing a public letter-post.
Still, it was a vast improvement on those of the preceding
reigns.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>In 1632, Charles I. approved of William Frizell and
Thomas Witherings, to whom the office had been assigned
by Lord Stanhope under James I.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen, as the head of the post-department,
gave general satisfaction, and tended much to satisfy
those who had just reason to complain of the system as
heretofore conducted.</p>

<p>1635.&mdash;Till this time there had been no certain and
constant intercourse between England and Scotland.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>
<p>Thomas Witherings, his majesty&#8217;s Postmaster of England
for foreign parts, was now commanded &#8220;to settle one or
two posts, to run day and night between Edinburg and
London; to go thither and come back again in six days;
and to take with them all such letters as shall be directed
to any post-town on the same road; and the posts to be
placed in several places out of the road, to run and bring
and carry out of the said roads the letters as there shall be
occasion, and to pay twopence for every single letter under
fourscore miles; and if one hundred and forty miles, fourpence;
and if above, then sixpence. The like rule the king
is pleased to order to be observed to Westchester, Holyhead,
and from thence to Ireland; and also to observe the like
rule from London to Plymouth, Exeter, and other places
in that road; the like from Oxford, Bristol, Colchester,
Norwich, and other places. And the king doth command
that no other messenger, foot-posts, shall take up, carry,
receive, or deliver any letter or letters whatsoever, other
than the messengers appointed by the said Thomas Witherings,
except common known carriers or particular messengers
to be sent on purpose with a letter to a friend.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Rushworth</i>,
vol. ii., p. 104.</p>

<p>It will be observed, by those who are acquainted with
the business of the postal department, that the above
forms the groundwork of that gigantic institution which,
linking itself with those of other nations, encircles the
whole civilized world.</p>

<p>After undergoing many and various changes, it became,
under the Protectorate, a sort of convenience for Cromwell
and his council, who, taking advantage of its immense
power, made it subservient to the interests of the commonwealth.
One of the peculiar features which it assumed
under Cromwell&#8217;s rule was that &#8220;it might be made
the agent in discovering and preventing many wicked
designs which have been and are daily contrived against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the peace and welfare of this commonwealth, the intelligence
whereof cannot well be communicated except by
letters of escript.&#8221;</p>

<p>A system of espionage was thus established which no one
having the interest of the nation and people at heart
could consistently subscribe to. But Cromwell&#8217;s rule was
based on fanaticism: hence those leading principles, the
result of a long and <i>religious</i> study, and which made up
the business character of England before he gained the
right to rule, were all swallowed up in the vortex of his
own created revolutions.</p>

<p>At the Restoration the system became adapted to the
more enlightened intellect of the people, and various
changes took place, which gave universal satisfaction.
These were made in the reign of Charles II.</p>

<p>Two years before the death of this monarch the first
penny post in England was established (1683).</p>

<p>This establishment was originated by one Murray, an
upholsterer, and it was afterwards assigned to Mr. William
Docwray, whose name long subsequently figured in post-office
annals. The penny post was found to be a decided
success. No sooner was this fact made apparent, than the
Duke of York, on whom and his heirs male in perpetuity
the entire revenue of the post-office had been settled by
stat. 15 Car. II. c. 14, complained that this post was an
infraction of his monopoly.</p>

<p>In 1685, Charles II. died, and, the Duke of York succeeding
his brother, the revenues of the post-office reverted
to the crown. Throughout the reign of James II. the
receipts of the post-office went on increasing, though no
great improvements were made in the administration. It
was this bigoted king who commenced the practice of
granting pensions out of the post-office revenues. The
year after he ascended the throne he granted &pound;4700 a year
to Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, one of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
brother&#8217;s many mistresses, to be paid out of the post-office
receipts. It is a curious and disgraceful fact that this
pension is still paid to the Duke of Grafton as her living
representative. The Earl of Rochester was allowed a
pension of &pound;4000 a year from the same source. These
pensions were paid during the reign of William and Mary,
and the following pensions were added:&mdash;</p>

<table width="50%" summary="pensions">
<tr>
<td class="left f9">Duke of Leeds</td>
<td class="right f9">&pound;3500</td>

<td class="right f9">2000</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="left f9">William Docwray, 1698</td>
<td class="right f9">500</td>
</tr></table>

<p>Among the post-office pensions granted in subsequent
reigns, Queen Anne gave one, in 1707, to the Duke of
Marlborough and his heirs of &pound;5000. The heirs of the
Duke of Schomberg were paid by the post-office till 1856,
when about &pound;20,000 were advanced to redeem a fourth
part of the pension, the burden of the remaining part
being then transferred to the Consolidated Fund. There
was, it must be admitted, some semblance of reason in
giving Docwray a pension, for he had claims as founder
of the district post or the penny post; but he only held
his pension for four years, losing both his emoluments and
his office in 1698, when charges of gross mismanagement
were brought against him. Some of the charges alleged
are curious. It was stated that he stopped &#8220;under spetious
pretences most parcells that are taken in, which is a great
damage to tradesmen, by loosing their customers or spoiling
their goods, and many times hazard the life of the
patient when physick is sent by a doctor or apothecary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten years after the removal of Docwray from his office,
another rival to the government department sprung up, in
the shape of a half-penny post. The scheme, established
by a Mr. Povey, never had a fair trial.</p>

<p>The first act for establishing a general post-office in <i>all</i>
her majesty&#8217;s dominions was the 9th Anne, c. 10. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
act, which remained long in force, was the foundation of
all subsequent legislation. By its provisions a general
post and letter office was established in London for Great
Britain, Ireland, North America, the West Indies, or any
other of her majesty&#8217;s dominions, or any country or kingdom
beyond the seas. To this end chief offices were
established in Edinburgh, at Dublin, at New York, and
in other convenient places in her majesty&#8217;s colonies of
America and the islands of the West Indies. The whole
of these chief offices were to be under the control of an
officer to be appointed by the queen by letters patent
under the great seal, by the name and style of Her
Majesty&#8217;s Postmaster-General. The improvements introduced
by this act increased the importance of the post-office
and added to the available revenue of the country.
For ten years no further steps were taken to develop the
service; but in 1720, Ralph Allen, immortalized by Pope,
appeared on the scene, and he was destined to be one of
the great improvers of the establishment. Mr. Allen,
who at this time was postmaster of Bath, and who from
his position was aware of the defects of the system, proposed
to the government to establish cross-posts between
Exeter and Chester, going by way of Bristol, Gloucester,
and Worcester, thus connecting the west of England with
the Lancashire district. The Bath postmaster proposed a
complete reconstruction of the cross-post system, guaranteeing
improvement to the revenue and increased accommodation
to the public. The Lords of the Treasury
granted him a lease of the cross-posts for life, his engagement
being to bear all the costs of the new service and to
pay a fixed rental of &pound;6000 per year. The contract was
several times renewed to Allen, the government on each
occasion stipulating that the service should be extended.
In this wise, in 1764, the period of Allen&#8217;s death, it was
found that the cross-posts had extended to all parts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
country. Notwithstanding the losses he suffered through
the dishonesty of country postmasters, Allen estimated
the net profits of his contract at the sum of &pound;10,000
annually: so that at the end of his official life he had
made nearly half a million sterling. He bestowed a considerable
part of his income in supporting needy men of
letters. He was the friend of Fielding, of Pope, and
Warburton. Fielding has drawn his character in the
person of Allworthy, and Pope has celebrated his benevolence
in the well-known lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,</div>
<div class="line i0">Do good by stealth and blush to find it fame.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On Allen&#8217;s death the cross-posts were brought under
the control of the postmaster-general, and the success of
the amalgamation was so complete that at the end of the
first year profits to the amount of &pound;20,000 were handed
over to the crown. In subsequent years the proceeds continued
to increase still more rapidly, so that when the by-letter
office was abolished in 1799 they had reached the
sum of &pound;200,000 per annum.</p>

<p>In the time of George I. the whole London post-office
establishment, which at present numbers several thousand
officers of different grades, was worked, without counting
letter-carriers, by a staff of thirty-two persons only.</p>

<p>The treasury warrants&mdash;warrants directed to the masters
of packet service, towards 1701&mdash;franked, as Mr.
Lewins observes, the strangest commodities. Among
others, fifteen couple of hounds going to the King of the
Romans, two maid-servants going as laundresses to my
lord ambassador Methuen, Doctor Chrichton, carrying with
him a case and divers necessaries, two bales of stockings
for the use of the ambassador to the court of Portugal,
and four flitches of bacon for Mr. Pennington, of Rotterdam.
Nor were these the only abuses. So little precaution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
was used in the reigns of George I. and George II.
that thousands of letters passed through the post-office
with the forged signatures of members. Even in the
early part of the reign of George III. it was related, in
the investigation of 1763, that one man had in the course
of five months counterfeited one thousand two hundred
dozens of franks of different members of Parliament. In
the year 1763 the worth of franked correspondence passing
through the post-office was estimated at &pound;170,000. In
1764, when George III. had been four years on the throne,
it was enacted that no letter should pass franked through
the post-office unless the whole address was in the M. P.&#8217;s
handwriting with his signature attached. In 1784, frauds
still continuing, it was ordered that franks should be
dated, the month should be given in full, such letters to
be put into the post on the day they were dated. From
1784 to the date of the penny postage, no further regulations
were made as to the franked correspondence, the
estimated value of which during these years was &pound;80,000
annually.</p>

<p>It was fifteen years after the death of the kindly and
benevolent Allen, the postmaster of Bath, that John
Palmer, also of Bath, and one of the greatest of post-office
reformers, rose into notice. Originally a brewer,
Mr. Palmer was in 1784 the manager of the Bath and
Bristol theatres. Having frequently to correspond with
and travel to London, Mr. Palmer found that letters
which left Bath on the Monday night were not delivered
in London until the Wednesday afternoon or night, but
that the stage-coach which left through the day on Monday
arrived in London on the following morning. He pointed
out to the authorities that commercial men and tradesmen,
for safety and speed, sent their correspondence as parcels,
robberies from carelessness and incompetence of post-office
servants being then frequent. Mr. Palmer was ready with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
remedies for these countless defects. In 1783 he submitted
his scheme to Mr. Pitt, who lent a ready ear. The
officials, however, were first to be consulted; and they,
as is their wont, made many and sweeping objections to
changes which they represented not only to be impracticable
and impossible, but dangerous to commerce and the
revenue. Mr. Pitt, however, as Mr. M. D. Hill says in
an article on the post-office, inherited his great father&#8217;s
contempt for impossibilities. He saw that Mr. Palmer&#8217;s
scheme would be as profitable as it was practicable, and he
resolved that it should be adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer was installed at the post-office on the day
of the change, under the title of Controller-General. It
was arranged that his salary should be &pound;1500 a year,
together with a commission of two and a half per cent.
upon any excess of revenue over &pound;240,000. The rates
of postage were now slightly raised; but, notwithstanding,
the number of letters began most perceptibly to increase.
Several of the principal towns, and notably Liverpool and
York, petitioned the treasury for the new mail-coaches.
But, though manifest success attended the introduction of
the Palmer scheme, yet the authorities were determinedly
opposed to the reformer, and he had to contend with them
single-handed. In 1792, when his plans had been about
eight years in operation and were beginning to exhibit
elements of success, it was deemed desirable that Palmer
should surrender his appointment. In consideration, however,
of his valuable services, a pension of &pound;3000 per
annum was granted to him; but this sum fell far short of
the emoluments which had been promised to him, and he
memorialized the government, but without success. He
protested against this treatment, and his son, General
Palmer, member for Bath, frequently urged his father&#8217;s
claims before Parliament; but it was not until 1813, after
a struggle of twenty years, that the House of Commons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
voted him a grant of &pound;50,000. This great benefactor
of his country died in 1818. In the first year of the introduction
of his plans, the net revenue of the post-office
was about &pound;250,000. Twenty years afterwards, the proceeds
had increased sixfold, to no less a sum than a million
and a half,&mdash;an increase doubtless partly attributable to
the increase of population, but mainly to the punctuality
and security of the new arrangements. Mails not only
travelled quicker, but Mr. Palmer augmented their number
between the largest towns: three hundred and eighty
towns, which had in the olden time but three deliveries a
week, had in 1797 a daily delivery. The Edinburgh coach
required less time by sixty hours to travel from London;
and there was a corresponding reduction between towns at
shorter distances. For many years after their introduction,
not a single attempt was made to rob Palmer&#8217;s mail-coaches,
which were efficiently guarded.</p>

<p>In 1836 there were fifty four-horse mails in England,
whereas forty years before there was not a third of the
number. We remember the annual procession of the
mail-coaches on the king&#8217;s birthday,&mdash;a gay spectacle,
which Mr. Lewins is not old enough to remember. Coachmen
and guards on that occasion donned a new red livery,
and all the coachmen and most of the guards wore bouquets
in their button-holes. In the year 1814 the business
of the post-office had increased so greatly that better
accommodation was sought than was afforded by the office
then in Lombard Street. The first general post-office,
opened in Cloak Lane, was removed from thence to the
Black Swan, in Bishopsgate Street. After the fire of 1666
a general post-office was opened in Covent Garden; but
it was soon removed to Lombard Street. In 1825 the
government acquiesced in the views of the great majority
of London residents, and St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand was chosen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
for the site of a new building, to be erected from the designs
of Sir R. Smirke.</p>

<p>It was opened for business in September, 1829. From
the date of the opening, improvements ceased to be pertinaciously
resisted. It was not, however, till the late
Duke of Richmond became the postmaster-general, in the
ministry of the late Earl Grey, in 1830, that improvements
were earnestly forwarded by the head of the department.
The duke, a highly public-spirited and patriotic
man, was indefatigable in the service of the department
over which he was placed from 1830 to 1834. At first
his grace refused to accept any remuneration for his services;
but at length, in compliance with the strong representations
of the treasury lords as to the objectionable
nature of gratuitous services, &#8220;which must involve in many
cases the sacrifice of private fortune to official station,&#8221;
he consented to draw his salary from the date of the treasury
minute already referred to. In 1834, Lord Grey&#8217;s
postmaster-general submitted a list of improvements to
the treasury lords, in which at least thirty substantial measures
of reform were proposed. It was under this functionary
that amalgamation of the Irish and Scotch offices
with the English took place.</p>

<p>The railway for the first few years of its existence exerted
but little influence on post-office arrangements. On
the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line, however,
in 1830, the mails of the district were consigned
to the new company for transmission. After railways had
been in existence seven or eight years, their influence became
paramount, and in 1838 and 1839 acts were passed
to provide for the conveyance of mails by them.</p>

<p>It was in 1836 that Sir Francis Freeling, who had been
secretary to the post-office since 1797, a period of forty
years, died. He was an industrious public servant of the
old school, strictly performing his duty according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
ancient precedent and routine. He was succeeded in his
office by Colonel Maberly, the son of a gentleman who,
having amassed a considerable fortune by trade, entered
Parliament, and ultimately succeeded Perry as the proprietor
of the &#8220;Morning Chronicle.&#8221; Colonel Maberly
had been himself in Parliament, and was generally considered
a good man of business; but he was an entire
stranger to the business of the post-office, and, according
to his own evidence before the Select Committee on Postage,
was introduced into the office by the treasury for the
purpose of carrying into effect the reforms which a commission
of inquiry had recommended.</p>

<p>On the fall of Sir R. Peel&#8217;s administration, in 1835,
the Earl of Lichfield succeeded to the office of postmaster-general
under Lord Melbourne. It must be admitted
that the new postmaster and secretary introduced many
important reforms. The money-order office was transferred
from private hands to the general establishment.
At this juncture also commenced the system of registering
valuable letters, and, at the suggestion of Mr. Rowland
Hill, a number of day mails were started for the provinces.</p>

<p>At the close of 1836 the stamp-duty on newspapers
was reduced from 3-1/4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>d.</i>,&mdash;a reduction which led to an
enormous increase in the newspapers passing through the
post-office.</p>

<p>But, though these improvements were in themselves
commendable, the authorities still tenaciously clung to the
old rates of postage, and refused to listen to any plan for
the reduction of postage-rates. Colonel Maberly, the
secretary, had no sooner learned the business of his office
than he made a proposition to the treasury that the letters
should be charged in all cases according to the exact distance
between the places where a letter was posted and delivered,
and not according to the full distance. The lords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of the treasury promptly refused, to use the language of
Mr. Lewins, &#8220;this concession.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1837 the average general postage was estimated at
9-1/2<i>d.</i> per letter; exclusive of foreign letters, it was still as
high as 8-3/4<i>d.</i> It is a curious but significant fact that in
the reign of Queen Anne the postage of a letter between
London and Edinburgh was less than half as much as
the amount charged at the accession of Queen Victoria.
The fact that the revenue derived from so well-protected
a monopoly remained stationary for nearly twenty years
may be fairly attributable to these high postage-rates.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lewins states that the revenue derived in 1815
from the post-office amounted to a million and a half;
while twenty-one years afterwards,&mdash;in 1836,&mdash;notwithstanding
the increase of trade and the diffusion of knowledge,
the increase of this sum had only been between
three and four thousand pounds. The evil of high rates
led not merely to small returns, but to the evasion of
postage by illicit means of conveyance, so that some carriers
of letters were doing as large a business as the post-office
itself.</p>

<p>This will appear evident from the statement that a post-office
official seized a parcel containing eleven hundred
letters in a single bag in the warehouse of a London carrier.
The head of this firm proffered instant payment of &pound;500
if the penalties were not sued for. The postmaster-general
accepted the offer, and the letters passed through the post-office
on the same night.</p>

<p>So early as 1833, the late Mr. Wallace, M. P. for Greenock,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
drew the attention of the House of Commons to the
numerous abuses in the post-office. There can be no
question that his frequent motions and speeches directed
public attention specifically to the subject and incalculably
advanced the cause of reform. Mr. Wallace was not
aided by the government or by the aristocracy or higher
professional classes; but he derived much active support
from the mercantile and manufacturing community, and
from the shopkeepers in all the great towns of the empire.</p>

<p>It was the ventilation of the subject of the post-office
by the member for Greenock that first drew the attention
of Mr.&mdash;now Sir&mdash;Rowland Hill, to the subject. The son
of a country schoolmaster, Mr. Hill had for a long time
acted as usher at his father&#8217;s establishment at Birmingham.
Being of an active and energetic disposition, he left the
paternal roof for the metropolis, and was in 1833, when
he was about thirty-eight years of age, secretary to the
commissioners for the colonization of South Australia.
Here he exhibited powers of organization, and we have
from his own pen a statement that he read very carefully
all the reports on post-office subjects. He put himself
into communication with Mr. Wallace, M. P., who afforded
him much assistance. He also corresponded with
Lord Lichfield, then postmaster-general, who imparted
to him the official information he sought. In January,
1837, Mr. Hill published the results of his investigations
and embodied his schemes in a pamphlet entitled
&#8220;Post-Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability.&#8221;
The pamphlet created a sensation in the mercantile world.
It was well noticed in the &#8220;Spectator&#8221; and &#8220;Morning
Chronicle,&#8221; to both of which journals Mr. Hill&#8217;s elder
brother Matthew, now a commissioner of bankruptcy at
Bristol, contributed. Mr. Rowland Hill contended that
the post-office was not making progress like other great
national interests,&mdash;that its revenue had diminished instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
of increased, though the population had augmented
six millions and trade and commerce had proportionally
increased. From data in his possession Mr. Hill pretty
accurately proved that the primary distribution, as he
called the cost of receiving and delivering the letters, and
also the cost of transit, took two-thirds of the total cost
of the management of the post-office. Out of the total
postal expenditure of &pound;700,000, Mr. Hill calculated that
the amount which had to do with the distance letters travelled
amounted to &pound;144,000. From calculations which
he then made, he arrived at the conclusion that the average
cost of conveying each letter was less than the one-tenth
of a penny. By this process he deduced the conclusion
that postage ought to be uniform. The propriety of a
uniform rate was further demonstrated by the fact that
under the old system the cost of transmission was not
always dependent on distance. The case was made still
plainer by these facts. An Edinburgh letter, costing the
post-office an infinitesimal fraction of a farthing, was
charged 1<i>s.</i> 1-1/2<i>d.</i>, while a letter for Louth, in Lincolnshire,
costing the post-office fifty times as much, was
charged 10<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Hill&#8217;s four proposals were:&mdash;1st, a large diminution
in the rates of postage, even to 1<i>d.</i> in a half-ounce
letter; 2d, increased speed in the delivery of letters; 3d,
more frequent opportunity for the despatch of letters;
4th, simplification and economy in the management of
the post-office, the rate of postage being uniform.</p>

<p>In February, 1838, Mr. Wallace moved for a select
committee of the Commons to investigate Mr. Hill&#8217;s proposals;
but the government resisted the measure. Lord
Lichfield, the postmaster-general, described it as a wild,
visionary, and extravagant scheme. The public at large
were greatly dissatisfied. Some of the most influential
men in the city of London established a committee for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the purpose of distributing information on the subject by
means of pamphlets and papers and for the general purposes
of the agitation. A month or two after Mr. Wallace&#8217;s
motion, Mr. Baring, then Chancellor of the Exchequer,
proposed a committee to inquire into the present
rates of charging postage, with a view to such reduction
as may be made without injury to the revenue, and for
them to examine into the mode of collecting and charging
postage recommended by Mr. Rowland Hill. The committee
sat sixty-three days, concluding their deliberations
in August, 1838. They examined the principal officers
of the post-office, and eighty-three independent witnesses.</p>

<p>In opposition to the views of official men, Mr. Hill
held that a fivefold increase in the number of letters would
suffice to preserve the existing revenue, and he predicted
that the increase would soon be reached. He showed that
the stage-coaches then in existence could carry twenty-seven
times the number of letters they had ever yet done.
The post-office authorities traversed every statement of
Mr. Hill and his supporters, and Colonel Maberly expressed
an opinion that if the postage were reduced to one
penny the revenue would not recover itself for forty or
fifty years. But, notwithstanding the opposition of the
post-office authorities, the committee reported for a reduction
of the rates, for the more frequent despatch of letters,
and for additional deliveries, adding that the extension of
railways made these changes urgently necessary. They
further urged that the principle of a low uniform rate was
just, and that when combined with prepayment it would
be convenient and satisfactory.</p>

<p>The commissioners, consisting of Lord Seymour, Lord
Duncannon, and Mr. Labouchere, proposed that any letter
not exceeding half an ounce should be conveyed free
within the metropolis, and the district to which the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and country deliveries extend, if enclosed in an envelope
bearing a penny stamp.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer had the plan of a
uniform rate of postage embodied in a bill, which passed
in the session of 1839. This act, approved by a majority
of one hundred and two members, conferred temporarily
the necessary power on the lords of the treasury. On the
12th of November, 1839, their lordships issued a minute
reducing the postage of all inland letters to the uniform
rate of 4<i>d.</i> The country was greatly dissatisfied. It required
Mr. Hill&#8217;s plan; and the fourpenny rate was in no
respect his. The treasury lords were at length convinced
they had made a mistake, and on the 10th of January,
1840, another minute was issued, ordering the adoption of
a uniform penny rate. On the 10th of August the treasury
had its minute confirmed by the statute 3 &amp; 4 Vict.
c. 96. A treasury appointment was given to Mr. Hill, to
enable him to assist in carrying out the penny postage.
He only, however, held the appointment for about two
years; for when the conservative party came into power
the originator of the penny postage lost his situation.
Mr. Hill entreated to be allowed to remain at any sacrifice
to himself, but Sir R. Peel was obdurate.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill&#8217;s popularity increased with his dismissal. A
public subscription was opened for him throughout the
country, as an expression of national gratitude, which
amounted to over &pound;13,000. On the restoration of the
whigs to power, in 1846, he was placed in St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand
as secretary to the postmaster-general. In 1854,
on Colonel Maberly&#8217;s removal to the audit-office, he was
named secretary to the post-office under the late Lord
Canning,&mdash;the highest appointment in the department.
In 1860 the secretary of the post-office was made a Knight
Commander of the Bath. During the autumn of 1863
his health began to fail him, and in March of the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
year (1865) he resigned his situation. The executive government
showed a just and liberal sense of Sir Rowland
Hill&#8217;s merits. By a treasury minute of the 11th of March,
1864, advantage was taken by the government of the
special clause in the Superannuation Act relating to extraordinary
services, to grant him a pension of three times
the usual retiring allowance. This was not merely a just
but a generous act; and the language in which the resolution
was couched was not official, nor solemnly and decorously
dull, as is usual on such occasions, but encomiastic
in the highest degree. Sir Rowland Hill was pronounced
not merely a meritorious public servant, but a &#8220;benefactor
of his race.&#8221; We do not say this eulogistic epithet was
not deserved, for we think it was well merited; but we
may be permitted to remark that Sir Rowland Hill has
lived in a felicitous time, thus promptly to find his merits
officially recognized on retiring from his labors.</p>

<p>Harvey, Jenner, Palmer of Bath, of whom we have
antecedently spoken, and scores of other discoverers and
philanthropists, were less fortunate than the late post-office
secretary. Sir Rowland Hill was not only allowed
to retire on his full salary of &pound;2000 per annum, but Lord
Palmerston gave notice that the pension should be continued
to Lady Hill in the event of her ladyship surviving
her husband.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Since this notice was given by the premier,
an influential deputation of the house waited on the first
minister of the crown, strongly urging that, in place of the
deferred pension to Lady Hill, a Parliamentary grant, sufficient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
though reasonable, should be made at once to the
late secretary.</p>

<p>We do not say that the social, moral, and commercial
results of the famous penny postage have not been singularly
wondrous and beneficial, and that Mr. Hill does not
deserve all that has been done for him by ministers, by
his private friends and admirers, by the commercial and
manufacturing community, and by the public at large.
We think the late post-office secretary fully deserves every
farthing that has been paid or that may be hereafter paid
to him, whether as an annuity or a gratuity; we think he
deserves the order of K.C.B., which he obtained, and,
further, that he deserves to have his merits and his name
commemorated by a statue intended to be erected at Birmingham
in his honor. But how few are there in this
world of ours who obtain a tithe of their deserts! Neither
Harvey, Jenner, Newton, nor Locke was properly rewarded
by his country. Newton, indeed, passed many
years of his life in straitened circumstances, and never
had any employment which produced him more than from
&pound;1200 to &pound;1500 per annum, while Locke&#8217;s commissionership
of appeals gave him only the miserable pittance of
&pound;200 a year. It is the good fortune of Sir Rowland
Hill to have flourished in more liberal times, when merit
is fittingly acknowledged and rewarded.</p>

<p>The discovery of Sir Rowland Hill was not a brilliant
and wonderful so much as a useful discovery, and there
can be no doubt that he worked out all the details with a
patience, a perseverance, and a judgment sure and unerring.
When the system of penny postage had been in
operation two years, it was found that the success of the
scheme had surpassed the most sanguine expectations. It
almost entirely prevented breaches of the law and that
illicit correspondence by which the revenue had long been
defrauded. Commercial transactions as to very small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
amounts were chiefly managed through the post: small
money-orders were constantly transmitted from town to
town and from village to village, the business of the
money-order office having increased twentyfold. No men
are more indebted to the system of the penny post than
literary men, publishers, and printers,&mdash;manuscripts and
proof-sheets now passing to and fro from one end of the
kingdom to the other with care, cheapness, and celerity.
Common carriers, too, are greatly benefited by the penny
postage. Pickford &amp; Co. now despatch by post more than
ten times the number of letters they despatched in 1839.
Mr. Charles Knight, the London publisher, stated that the
penny postage stimulated every branch of his trade, and
brought the country booksellers into daily communication
with the London houses. Mr. Bagster, the publisher of
the Polyglot Bible in twenty-four languages, stated to
Mr. Hill that the revision which he was just giving to his
work would on the old system have cost him &pound;1500 in
postage alone, and that the Bible could not be printed but
for the penny post. One of the principal advocates for
the repeal of the Corn Laws stated that the objects of the
league were achieved two years earlier than otherwise,
owing to the introduction of cheap postage. Conductors
of schools and educational establishments stated how people
were learning everywhere to write for the first time, in
order to enjoy the benefits of a free correspondence. In
all the large towns, too, it was remarked that night-classes
were springing up for teaching writing to adults. As the
system made progress with the public, Mr. Hill&#8217;s recommendations
and improvements extended and expanded.
A cheap registration started into existence, simplification
was introduced in the mode of sorting letters, slits were
suggested in the doors of houses, restriction as to the
weight of parcels was removed, and a book-rate was established.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
It was also suggested that railway stations should
have post-offices connected with them, and that sorting
should be done in the train and in the packets. The union
of the two corps of general and district letter-carriers, the
establishment of district offices, and an hourly delivery
instead of every two hours, were also suggested by Mr.
Hill, and, after being strenuously combated by the authorities,
carried by the indefatigable secretary.</p>

<p>The amalgamation of the general post and what were
called the London district carriers did not take place till
1855, when the Duke of Argyll was postmaster-general.
For this amalgamation Mr. Hill had been striving from
the commencement. It avoided the waste of time, trouble,
and expense consequent on two bodies of men&mdash;the one
being paid at a much higher rate of wages&mdash;going over
the same ground.</p>

<p>A more important step than this was the division of
London into ten districts. Under the new arrangement,
instead of district letters being carried from the receiving
houses to the chief office in St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand, to be
there sorted and redistributed, they were sorted and distributed
at the district office according to their address.
An important part of the new scheme was that London
should be considered in the principal post-offices as ten
different towns, each with its own centre of operations,
and that the letters should be assorted and despatched on
this principle. A new and special service was brought
into operation between England and Ireland on the 1st of
October, 1860. Night and day mail-trains have from that
date been run from Euston Square to Holyhead, and
special steamers have been employed at an enormous
expense to cross the channel. Letter-sorting is now carried
on not only in the trains but on board the packets,
nearly all the post-office work for immediate delivery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
being accomplished between London and Dublin and
Dublin and London respectively.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The first letter penny post was established in Edinburgh
by one Peter Williamson, a native of Aberdeen. He kept a
coffee-shop in the Parliament House, and as he was frequently
employed, by gentlemen attending the courts, in
sending letters to different parts of the city, and as he had
doubtless heard something of the English penny post, he
began a regular post with hourly deliveries, and established
agents at different parts of the city to collect.</p>

<p>The postal districts of London are so arranged as to
render favorable not only the facilities for delivering letters,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
but equally so to the carriers. The employees of the London
post-office are not overtasked, nor are the carriers compelled
as it were to become &#8220;beasts of burden.&#8221; A want
of consideration on the part of officials here for those in
their employ is a sad reflection on our republican institutions.
Men who exercise a little brief authority imagine
themselves for the time-being taskmasters, and those in
their employ slaves. Nothing in the world tends more to
change a man&#8217;s politics than the abuses arising out of the
system pursued by men in power towards those in their
employ. Thus comparisons are drawn between the two
parties, and the course of each is canvassed; and not unfrequently,
we regret to say, the Democracy has the advantage.
It has always been a principle of the Democratic party to
take care of &#8220;their men.&#8221; It is a fact that under Democratic
administration the salaries of the employees in the
post-office were thirty-three and one-third per cent more
than they receive at present, and that, too, when gold was
at par and the rate of living fifty per cent cheaper than it
is now. The fact is, there are not ten men in the post-office
department whose salaries are adequate to their wants;
and to their just demand for an increase of salary they
are coolly answered that &#8220;if they are not satisfied they
can resign, as there are plenty outside willing to take
their place.&#8221; Is it to be expected that men so treated
can consistently admire a system or maintain a principle
that strikes at the root of their interest and patriotism?
In another part of this work we have alluded to
this subject, and referring to it here is simply to contrast
a portion of our postal system with that of the English.
Let it be distinctly understood that these remarks
apply as much to the heads of the postal department at Washington
as they do to their officials: the latter simply imitate
the actions and carry out the plans of their superiors, and
not unfrequently in a manner as insulting as their action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and conduct are repulsive. Men in power should be gentlemen;
and in selecting their assistants, this natural
attribute of the man, refined by education, would exercise
its influence in such a manner as to render such selection
a very easy matter. But, unfortunately, in many instances
such is not the case. The great error committed by the
<i>fortunate candidates</i> for office is that of assuming consequence,
or, to use a more familiar phrase, &#8220;putting on airs:&#8221;
it is an error that in part arises out of our system of
government, and is one that can only be corrected by
placing gentlemen in high positions, instead of ignorant,
brawling politicians. It is true, our government is not
established upon a state religious basis; or, if it were so
intended, that corner-stone has been misplaced. Our rulers
are generally politicians. To obtain office, corruption not
unfrequently takes precedence of religion: hence injustice,
wrong, and oppression are the means used to insure success.
Examples thus set in high places have been followed
through all the departments; peculation in office, fraud in
agents, government itself cheated, are all indications of
corruption, and are the strongest evidences to be adduced
for the increase of crime, the disregard of truth, and the
absence of morality among us. Even our clergy display
more of the</p>

<p>The English post-office, to a certain extent, is a political
one; but there is one feature in it which differs materially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
from our own, and it is one that reflects the highest credit
on the English government; and that is, a man is not discharged
from office simply on political grounds, but is
retained as long as he attends to his business and conducts
himself properly. The reward of merit and long service
is, when incapable of attending to his duties, a pension
from his government. With these remarks, elicited by
contrasting the two systems, we annex the following synopsis
of the London postal arrangements:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f9">(From the London &#8220;Postal Guide&#8221; for 1864.)</p>

<p>The London district comprises all places within a circle
of twelve miles from the general post-office, including
Cheshunt, Hampton, Hampton Court, and Sunbury, and
the post towns of Barnet, Waltham Cross, Romford, Bromley,
Croydon, Kingston, and Hounslow. It is divided
into ten postal districts, each of which is treated, in many
respects, as a separate post town. The following are the
names of the districts, with their abbreviations, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>By adding the initials of the postal districts to the
addresses of letters for London and its neighborhood, the
public will much facilitate the arrangements of the post-office.</p>

<p>The district initials for every important street or place
are given in the street list.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>TOWN DELIVERIES.</i></h3>

<p>The portion of each district within about three miles of
the general post-office is designated the town delivery, and
the remainder the suburban delivery.</p>

<p>Within the town limits there are twelve deliveries of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
letters daily. The first, or general post delivery, including
all inland, colonial, and foreign letters arriving in sufficient
time, commences about 7.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, and is generally completed
throughout London by nine o&#8217;clock, except on Mondays,
or on other days when there are large arrivals of
letters from abroad.</p>

<p>The second delivery, which commences about nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>,
includes the correspondence received by the night mails
from Ireland and France, and letters from the provinces
and abroad which may arrive too late for the first delivery,
as well as those posted in the nearer suburbs by 6.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>,
as specified in the tables for each district.</p>

<p>The next nine deliveries are made hourly, and include
all letters reaching the general post-office or the district
offices in time for each despatch.</p>

<p>The last delivery commences about 7.45 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Each delivery within the town limits occupies about an
hour from the time of its commencement, which may be
averaged at from forty-five minutes to an hour from the
time of despatch from the general post-office, according to
the distance from St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand and the number
of letters to be arranged by the letter-carriers for distribution.</p>

<p>The provincial day mails are due at various times, and
the letters are included in the next delivery after their
arrival in London. The day mails from Ireland, France,
and the continent generally, and the letters received from
Brighton and other towns which have a late afternoon
communication with London, are delivered the same evening
in London and the suburbs within the six-mile circle.</p>

<p>The suburban deliveries are regulated in a similar manner,
with this difference, however, that in some of the less-thickly
inhabited portions the deliveries are necessarily
fewer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE POSTE RESTANTE.</i></h3>

<p>There is more attention paid in England to this letter
or paper inscription than there is with us. The &#8220;Poste
Restante&#8221; being intended solely for the accommodation of
strangers and travellers who have no permanent abode in
London, letters for residence in London <i>must not be addressed</i>
&#8220;Post-Office till called for.&#8221; Letters addressed
to &#8220;initials&#8221; or &#8220;fictitious names&#8221; cannot be received at
the &#8220;Poste Restante.&#8221; If so addressed, they are returned
to the writers.</p>

<p>With us, little or no attention is paid to this important
postal matter: hence, a letter addressed simply to &#8220;John
Smith, Philadelphia,&#8221; without the word &#8220;Transient,&#8221; &#8220;or
Poste Restante,&#8221; must necessarily take its winding way
through all the phases of postal travel until it reaches the
dead-letter office. We make another extract from the English
&#8220;Postal Guide:&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letters for strangers are delivered from the Poste
Restante for a period of two months; after which period
they must have them addressed to their place of residence,
in order that they may be sent by the letter-carriers. Letters
for known residents in London, addressed to the &#8216;Poste
Restante,&#8217; are retained for one week only.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letters addressed &#8216;Post-Office, London,&#8217; or &#8216;Poste
Restante, London,&#8217; are delivered only at the Poste Restante
office, on the south side of the hall of the general post-office,
St. Martin&#8217;s-le-Grand; and at this office also, and
there only, are delivered letters addressed to the district
or branch offices in London. The hours of delivery are
between nine and five.</p>

<p>&#8220;All persons applying for letters at the Poste Restante
must be prepared to give the necessary particulars to the
clerk on duty, in order to prevent mistakes, and to insure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the delivery of the letters to the persons to whom they
properly belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The establishment of a &#8220;Poste Restante&#8221; on this principle
would be an important feature in our post-office, and
would save both trouble and expense.</p>

<b>The Kaffir Letter-Carrier&mdash;African Post.</b></h2>

<p>The African post, as we term it, is of course simply
connected with the European settlements. A system of
carrying letters is established, and the principal messengers
or carriers are the Kaffirs. In the several settlements,
more particularly those of the British at Sierra Leone,
Cape Coast Castle, and the Cape of Good Hope, and
at several unimportant establishments on the Gold and
Silver Coasts, these messengers of the African race were
not only very useful in conveying letters, packages, &amp;c., but
honest, trustworthy, and remarkably swift of foot. In
Sierra Leone more particularly they were considered very
important personages. In 1845 there was a well-known
character, called the &#8220;Kaffir letter-carrier.&#8221; He was employed
to convey letters to the South African settlement.
He carried his document in a split at the end of a long
stick. He took great interest in his employment; and if
a vessel arrived at a late hour of the night, and the letter
came into his possession before morning, he would start off
with it: no matter how dark the night or how great the
distance, away he would speed. When he reached the house
of the person to whom the letter was directed,&mdash;one of his
customers,&mdash;he would commence shouting and knocking;
and as soon as the house was alarmed, he would exclaim,
&#8220;Ah, massa, here de right book come at last!&#8221; This expression
was caused by the anxiety manifested by the Europeans
generally to receive letters and packages by every vessel.
Another reason that might be assigned for the activity
displayed by the Kaffir letter-carrier was the fact that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
usually displayed some extra trinket immediately after
the delivery of his letter or package. The free-delivery
system had not been adopted in Africa at that period, nor
do we believe it can boast of that liberal governmental
privilege yet.</p>

<p>The name of Kaffir, or unbeliever, was originally given
to the inhabitants of the southern coast of Africa by the
Moors; and, being adopted by the Portuguese, it became
the common appellation of all the tribes occupying the
southeastern coast. The Kaffirs living beyond the Fish
River, on the eastern boundary of the colony, are a bold,
warlike, and independent people, and are supposed to be
of Arabian origin.</p>

under the belief of witchcraft would never have occurred
here; but, unfortunately, that evil came over with the
&#8220;Pilgrim Fathers,&#8221; and its consequences gave a dark
page to the history of the &#8220;Land of Promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apart from this, however, their landing on Plymouth

new paths of gain and of information.&#8221;</p>

<div class="line i1">They sought a faith&#8217;s pure shrine!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Passing over the dark days of witchcraft and the persecution
of the Quakers, the colonial history brightens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
up under a more tolerant rule. That the belief in witchcraft
was a delusion arising from ignorance, under the
influence of which many persons became frantic, there
can be no doubt. And yet there was a method in their
madness so cunningly carried out that it deceived many
far more enlightened. A writer speaking upon the subject
says, &#8220;It is but justice to the inhabitants of New
England to observe that, though the present age may
censure the past for its superstition, neither England nor
any other nation is entitled to cast the first stone at them.
More persons were put to death in England in a single
county, in a few months, than suffered in all the colonies
during the whole period of their existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scenes that were enacted in New England during
this epidemical reign of insanity gradually yielded to the
influence of reason, which under proper religious discipline
once more assumed its rule. One of the chief
causes which tended to arouse the mind from its mental
darkness was the fact of a dog being taken up on suspicion,
and actually hanged, as an accomplice of his master,
who was accused of witchcraft!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> This act capped the
climax of folly. People began to wonder if such things
could be; and they actually took the case of the dog into
serious consideration, and then came to this very wise conclusion,&mdash;that
he fell a martyr to the folly and ignorance
of a few fanatics. They then began to ridicule those who
assumed the power to terrify the people and who had
exercised it to a bitter end over men and animals. This
did more to bring men to their senses than all the preaching
and reasoning of the elders previously.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p><p>Naturally, while these idiotic scenes were enacting, the
arts and sciences, commerce and manufactures, were materially
neglected; but when the gloom which fanaticism
had cast over this portion of the colonies had passed away,
the dawn of <i>reason and civilization</i> awoke her benighted
children to a new state of existence.</p>

<p>To trace up the postal history of the colonies to the
glorious epoch of our independence would be to give
a history of trade and commerce, science and art. To
these do every thing useful and ornamental in the New
World owe its existence. It is true the postal department
was at the early age of colonial history but a minor
consideration. The system was a limited one, and consisted
in having post-roads and post-riders. Even here
the latter were to be seen &#8220;like angels&#8217; visits, few and
far between.&#8221; We can draw one of these from a picture
seen in our boyhood days. It was in the good old State
of Pennsylvania, not many miles from the city of Philadelphia,
and while trudging on our way to the village
school, this living picture presented itself. A tall, gaunt
man sat on a tall, gaunt horse; he came riding slowly up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the road,&mdash;this was not, as now, a fast age: his hair was
partly gray, and fell in tow-looking ringlets down and
around his long, sinewy neck. Over the horse&#8217;s back
was swung a large, well-filled pair of saddle-bags. He
was the post-rider. He had started from the main post
of the county, established in Norristown, to others in
directions diverging from the main road. He stopped
his horse, and, raising his tall form, resting his feet on
a pair of old rusty stirrups, he shouted out, in a voice of
mimic thunder, &#8220;Look here, Jim: take this letter to
your mother, &#8217;mediate; for that is written on the back;
and as you pass Mrs. Stroud&#8217;s, hand her this newspaper.
Do this, Jim, and I&#8217;ll give you sixpence next pay-day.&#8221;
Such was the post.</p>

<p>Connected with this little incident there is a somewhat
curious coincidence. Little did the writer think then,
while acting as &#8220;an incipient post,&#8221; he should in after years
find himself in a position in the Philadelphia post-office,
acting first as a carrier, and then as clerk, and whose early
vocations in life were in no manner identified with public
men and public institutions. But what will not revulsions
in trade, politics, and governments effect! Equally strange,
too, that forty years after the little incident of the &#8220;old
post&#8221; he should meet in the same office the son of that
same Mrs. Stroud mentioned above, acting in a similar
capacity. Truly may it be said that &#8220;<i>coming events cast
their shadows before</i> us on our boyhood&#8217;s wayward path.&#8221;
But this is a digression.</p>

<p>Expresses and regular messengers were employed by
the colonists, and horses were kept in constant readiness
to start on a moment&#8217;s notice with letters or packets, for
the government as well as individuals. There was no
established postal system but that which the exigencies of
the times created. The post-riders, or rather government
messengers, ran frequent risks. Captain Hutchinson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
started July 4, 1665, sent by the Governor of Massachusetts
with letters constituting him a commissioner to treat
with the Narragansetts. The &#8220;letter system&#8221; failed to
conciliate the tribe, as they had openly declared for Philip;
and here we have another illustration of the fact that
in cases of war and rebellion the &#8220;sword is mightier than
the pen.&#8221; The colonial forces marched into their country
and compelled them to sign a treaty, which, however, was
only considered binding as long as the forces sent against
them were present.</p>

<p>In 1676, however, the colonial court established a post-office
in Boston, appointing John Heyward postmaster.
Heyward followed the system as established in England,
and placed posts and made routes to the extent of the
commercial interest of the State. This gave general satisfaction
to those who were interested in this mode of communicating
with men connected with them in trade, as
also to others who had friends and relations scattered
throughout what was then a thinly-populated State.</p>

<p>In the year 1700, Col. J. Hamilton, of New Jersey, and
son of Governor Andrew Hamilton, first devised the post-office
scheme for British America, for which he obtained
a patent and the profits accruing. Afterwards he sold it
to the crown, and a member of Parliament was appointed
for the whole, with a right to have his substitute reside in
New York. The statute of Anne, in 1716, placed the
postal department under the immediate control of the
crown.</p>

<p>The first regular post-office established in the colonies
by Parliament was in 1710. By its provisions a general
post-office was established in North America and the West
Indies, or any other of her majesty&#8217;s dominions, or in any
country or kingdom beyond the seas, and &#8220;at which office
all returns and answers may be likewise received. For
the better managing, ordering, collecting, and improving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the revenue, and also for the better computing and setting
the rates of letters according to distance, a chief office is
established in Edinburgh, one in Dublin, one at New
York, and other chief offices in convenient places in her
majesty&#8217;s colonies of America, and one in the islands of
the West Indies, called the &#8216;Leeward Islands.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>That our readers may form some idea of the limited
use of a post-office at that period, it is only necessary to
state the fact that in 1708 New York contained but one
thousand houses, most of them substantially built. The
great Trinity Church, so called then, was erected in 1695.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
A library was established there in 1700, and the post-office,
as stated above, in 1710. The post-horse system, such as
was pursued in England, continued, nor was it until 1732
that the first stage-route to Philadelphia was established:
stages also departed for Boston monthly, taking a fortnight
on the route.</p>

<p>The following announcement is taken from the &#8220;Philadelphia
Weekly Mercury,&#8221; dated November 30, 1752:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Monday next the Northern post sets out from New
York, in order to perform his stage but once a fortnight
during the winter quarter; the Southern post changes also,
which will cause this paper to come out on Tuesdays
during that time. The colds which have infested the
Northern colonies have been also troublesome here; few
families have escaped the same; several have been carried
off by the cold, among whom was David Brintnall, in the
seventy-seventh year of his age. He was the first man
that had a brick house in the city of Philadelphia, and
was much esteemed for his just and upright dealing.
There goes a report here that the Lord Baltimore and his
lady are arrived in Maryland, but, the Southern post being
not yet come in, the said report wants confirmation.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>
<p>The David Brintnall mentioned here built the first
house made of brick in the city of Philadelphia: it was
situated in Chestnut Street below Fourth, and stood back
from the street-line, with a small garden in front. The
first house erected in Philadelphia was a wooden one, on
the east side of Front Street, a little north of the place
now called &#8220;Little Dock Street,&#8221; and is said not to have
been finished when William Penn first arrived. The
owner, John Guest, kept a public house there for many
years. His sign was a &#8220;Blue Anchor.&#8221; The town and
boroughs of Philadelphia were located in 1682.</p>

<p>Letters between New York and Boston were, previous
to the introduction of stages, conveyed on horseback.
Madam Knight, in her journal, dated 1704, says that
&#8220;she was two weeks in riding with the postman, as her
guide, from Boston to New York. In most of the towns
she saw Indians.&#8221; In 1702, Mrs. Shippen, soon after her
marriage, came from Boston to Philadelphia on horseback,
<i>bringing a baby on her lap</i>.</p>

<p>Even at a much later period the mode of travelling was
still in a slow way, as may be seen by the following advertisement,
which appeared in 1776:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;This is to give notice to the Publick that the stage
waggons kept by John Burrowhill, in Elm Street, in Philadelphia,
and John Mersereax, at the Blazing Star, near New
York, intend to perform the journey from Philadelphia to
New York in two days; also to continue seven months,
viz.: from the 14th of April to the 14th of November,
and the remaining five months of the year in three days.
The waggons to be kept in good order, and good horses,
with sober drivers. They purpose to set off from Philadelphia
on Mondays and Thursdays punctually at sunrise,
and to be in Prince-Town the same nights, and change
passengers, and return to New York and Philadelphia the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
following days. The passengers are desired to cross Powlass
Hook Ferry the evening before. The waggon is not
to stay after sunrise. Price, each passenger, from Powlass
Hook to Prince Town, ten shillings; from thence to
Philadelphia, ten shillings also; Ferriage free. Threepence
each mile any distance between. Any gentlemen or ladies
that wants to go to Philadelphia, can go in the stage and
be home in five days, and be two nights and one day in
Philadelphia to do business or see the market-days. All
gentlemen and ladies who are pleased to favour us with
their custom may depend on due attendance and civil usage
by those humble servants,</p>

<p class="name">

</p>

<p class="small padl1">&#8220;June, 1776.&#8221;</p>

<p>Market-days in Philadelphia at that period, and long
afterwards, were great attractions to the country-people,
even apart from business. It was also customary to ring
the bells of Christ Church on the evenings previous to
&#8220;market-days&#8221; for the edification of the country-people,
who had learned to look upon them&mdash;or at least to hear
their sound&mdash;as more or less identified with our independence.
There is a peculiar history attached to these bells.
They were purchased in England at a cost of &pound;900.
There were eight of them, and their aggregate weight was
eight thousand pounds, the tenor bell weighing eighteen
hundred pounds. In 1777, fearful of their falling back
again into English hands, they were taken down and conveyed
to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for &#8220;<i>safe keeping</i>.&#8221;
After the evacuation of the city they were replaced, and
have been ringing joyfully ever since. They pealed forth
in gladsome sounds when the old State-House Bell sounded
its note to liberty, and in harmony they proclaimed it to
the world. But did the world respond? Did it shake off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the bonds which bound man to man by an iron chain?
Did it &#8220;proclaim&#8221; alike to the African that freedom was
his birthright? Alas! no; for although the Declaration
of our Independence pronounced &#8220;all men equal,&#8221; yet a
distinction was made in color, and, under that very document
and the Constitution, slavery came in, to become in
time, what it was in reality before, a curse.</p>

<p>Years passed on; trade and traffic in human flesh continued,
until the Almighty, in his wondrous mystery,
brought about their emancipation in a manner that levelled
the institution of slavery to the ground forever. But,
alas! have we not as a people and a nation been severely
punished? Established on a basis of crime and carried
out in a spirit of fiendish ferocity, they dared call it a
&#8220;divine institution.&#8221; For this fearful error on the part
of those eminent men who framed that document, our
country has suffered fearfully; but these bells and all
other bells will peal once more under a new order of
things, and truly as well as righteously &#8220;proclaim liberty
throughout the land to all the people thereof.&#8221; Then
will our land</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>EARLY POSTS.</i></h3>

<p>New York, like Pennsylvania, has its primitive postal
history. The first postmaster at Schenectady was Dr.
Eleazer Mosely, who died in 1833, aged seventy-three
years. He established a post by raising subscriptions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
from the inhabitants, which operated very favorably; and
the result was the carrying the mail by contract.</p>

<p>At first the western mail was carried from Albany once
a week, in a valise on the shoulder of a footman.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1810 there was only a weekly mail
between Canandaigua and Genesee River, carried on horseback,
and part of the time by a <i>woman</i>!</p>

<p>In 1730 notice was published to this effect:&mdash;&#8220;<i>Whosoever
inclines to perform the foot-post to Albany this winter
is to make application to Richard Nichols, the postmaster.</i>&#8221;
Only think of this, ye modern letter-carriers!</p>

<p>The carrying of the mail between New York and Philadelphia
previous to the Revolution was a very small
matter: it was hardly an affair to be robbed. It was
carried by a boy, who took the whole in saddle-bags, on
horseback, three times a week. Next it was carried in a
sulky;&mdash;next in coaches. What is it now?</p>

<p>In 1753 the post-office at the Bowling Green, Broadway,
was, as announced, &#8220;opened everyday save Saturday
afternoons, and Sundays from eight to twelve <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> and
from two to four <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>NEW YORK POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>The original office was situated at the corner of William
and Garden Streets, in which house resided the then Postmaster-General,
Theodorus Bailey. It was also the residence
of Sebastian Ballman, the first postmaster of the
city subsequently to the Revolution, who was appointed to
the office by General Washington. The room used as an
office was twenty-five to thirty-five feet in length, and
contained one hundred boxes. In 1827 it was in the
basement of the &#8220;Merchants&#8217; Exchange,&#8221; occupying two-thirds
of that extensive space. The Merchants&#8217; Exchange
is situated on Wall Street. It is built of white marble.
Its front on Wall Street is one hundred and fourteen feet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and its depth, extending to Garden Street, one hundred
and fifty feet. The portico of the building, to which a
flight of marble steps ascends, is ornamented with Ionic
columns twenty-seven feet high.</p>

<p>In 1844 the post-office was removed to a new building,&mdash;the
first, we believe, ever erected in that city expressly for
postal purposes.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> It is situated on Nassau Street, and reflects
but little credit to the city either for its architectural
or business-like appearance. There is many a lager-beer
establishment can compete with almost any post-office in
this country in point of those attractive qualities in architectural
design in which they are so totally deficient. In
this, however, we are not surprised; for the former has
become an institution that may well claim precedence
over almost any other in the country. Lager-beer saloons
are institutions dedicated to death: hence their motto
should be the Dutch word for <i>beer</i>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bier</span>.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>INDEPENDENT POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>An independent post-office was established in New
York in 1775. It was suggested by William Goddard,
the publisher of the &#8220;Maryland Journal,&#8221; and John
Holt, the printer, was appointed postmaster. It went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
into (partial) operation on the 11th of May. The office
was kept at Holt&#8217;s printing-office.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the &#8220;Sons of Liberty,&#8221; a popular
association of Americans, were connected with this movement;
for one of the first acts of its members was to send,
through this office, threatening letters to the leading members
of the tory party. This association took the lead in
political matters, and exercised a powerful influence over
the masses.</p>

<p>They also, in the dead hour of the night, went to Holt&#8217;s
printing-office and printed inflammatory handbills themselves,
and then circulated them throughout the city.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>JOHN HOLT.</i></h3>

<p>This gentleman was originally mayor of Williamsburg,
Virginia. He also established a newspaper there, and
rendered important service to the cause of the patriots.
He came to New York, where ten years before he had
published the &#8220;New York Gazette and Post-Boy&#8221; in
company with James Parker. He started another paper
shortly after his arrival in New York. When the British
took possession of the city, he left it, and published his
journal at Esopus and Poughkeepsie. While at the former
place he published Burgoyne&#8217;s pompous proclamation,
also the full account of the dreadful massacre in the
Wyoming Valley. Holt died January 30, 1784, aged
sixty-four years.</p>

<p>The tongue of slander found no poison in his life to
bait shafts with; and justice, having awarded him all
praise in life, left his memory and his acts to the historian.</p>

<b>Pennsylvania&mdash;The Olden Time.</b></h2>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</i></h3>

<p>William Penn, the founder of the colony of Pennsylvania,
was born in London in the year 1644. His
father, Sir William Penn, was distinguished in the British
navy as an able admiral, being commander of the fleet
at the reduction of Jamaica in 1655, and contributing
greatly to the defeat of the Dutch fleet in 1664. For his
services he was knighted by Charles II.</p>

<p>William Penn was entered in 1660, as a gentleman
commoner, at Christ&#8217;s Church, Oxford; but, withdrawing
from the national forms of worship, in connection with
other students, who like himself had attended the preaching
of Thomas Loe, an eminent member of the Society
of Friends, commonly called Quakers, he was punished
by fine for nonconformity, and in the succeeding year, for
pertinacious adherence to his opinions, was expelled from
the college. His father, considering that his singularly
sober and serious manner of life tended to prevent his
elevation to the honors of Charles&#8217;s licentious court, was
indignant at his disgrace, and therefore turned him out
of doors in 1662, after, as he says, being whipped and
beaten.</p>

<p>He was, however, sent by his father to France, and after
his return was entered at Lincoln&#8217;s Inn as a law-student.
He renewed his acquaintance with Loe in Ireland, where
he had been sent to manage an estate in 1666, and showed
so much partiality to the persecuted sect of Quakers that
he was arrested at a meeting in Cork and imprisoned by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the authorities, who at last restored him to liberty at the
intercession of some influential persons. He returned to
England, when he had a violent altercation with his father,
who was desirous that he should abandon habits so singular,
so offensive to decorum, and so opposed to established
forms; and, refusing to appear uncovered before
the king and before his father, he was a second time dismissed
in disgrace from protection and favor.</p>

<p>In consequence of a controversial dispute in 1668, when
he first appeared as a preacher, he was sent to the Tower,
where he remained a prisoner for seven months, and
shortly after his release he was, on the passing of the
Conventicle Act, again sent to prison in Newgate,&mdash;from
which he was liberated by the interest of his father, who
about this time became reconciled to him, and, dying some
time after, left him an estate of &pound;1500 per annum. Marrying
in 1672, he fixed his residence in Hertfordshire,
occupying himself zealously in promoting the cause of
the Friends both by preaching and writing.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from Holland, whither he had
gone in 1677 to assist at a general meeting of Friends,
he petitioned his majesty Charles II. for a grant of land
lying north of that already granted to Lord Baltimore,
and west of the now Delaware. In consideration of his
father&#8217;s services, and of a debt of sixteen thousand pounds
due the admiral at his decease, the grant was readily
made, to which the Duke of York added by cession a
neighboring portion of territory on the Delaware to the
south of the king&#8217;s grant. The patent bore date March 4,
1680-81; and in this instrument the king gave the name
of Pennsylvania to the province, in honor of Admiral
Sir William Penn.</p>

<p>The day after the charter was granted to Penn, he
wrote a letter to Robert Turner, in which he gives the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
particulars of the naming of his province. The essential
parts of this letter we quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220; ... Know that, after many waitings, watchings,
solicitings, and disputes in council, this day my country
was confirmed to me under the great seal of England,
with large powers and privileges, by the name of Pennsylvania,
a name the king would give it in honor of my
father. I chose New Wales, being a pretty hilly country;
but Penn being Welsh for <i>a head</i>, as Penmanmoire in
Wales, and Penrith in Cumberland, and Penn in Buckinghamshire,
the highest land in England, called this
Pennsylvania, which is the <i>high</i> or <i>head woodlands</i>; for
I proposed, when the secretary, a Welshman refused
to have it called New Wales, <i>Sylvania</i>, and they added
<i>Penn</i> to it, and though I much opposed it, and went to
the king to have it struck out and altered, he said it was
past, and would take it upon him; nor could twenty
guineas move the under-secretaries to vary the name, for
I feared lest it should be looked on as a vanity in me, and
not as a respect in the king, as it truly was, to my father,
whom he often mentions with praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The charter constituting William Penn and his heirs
true and absolute proprietaries of Pennsylvania, saving to
the crown their allegiance and the sovereignty, is preserved
in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth at
Harrisburg. Being thus constituted absolute proprietor
and governor of Pennsylvania, Penn published &#8220;A Brief
Account of the Province,&#8221; proposing terms of settlement
to such as might choose to remove thither; in which land
was offered to purchasers at forty shillings per hundred
acres, with a quit-rent of one shilling per annum. Many
persons embraced his offer, and several companies of emigrants
sailed to take possession of their new purchase,
landing December, 1681, at Chester.</p>

<p>While the colony was thus commenced, Penn remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
in England, occupied in forming a government for his
people and providing means for its security.</p>

<p>Early in 1682 the proprietary published &#8220;The Frame
of Government of the Province of Pennsylvania, together
with Certain Laws, &amp;c.,&#8221; in the preface to which is found
a sketch of his sentiments on the form and substance of
civil government.</p>

<p>The governor, having completed all his preparations,
sailed early in the fall of 1682, in company with about
one hundred colonists, mostly Quakers from his own
neighborhood, of which number, however, about thirty
persons perished by small-pox, which broke out after their
departure.</p>

<p>The first colonists sent out, being chiefly of the Society
of Friends, with the predominating characteristics of their
people, temperance, industry, and economy, and conducting
themselves in the difficulties and hardships of their new
situation with much prudence and circumspection, avoided
most of the dangers to which a new colony is usually
subject, and received with demonstrations of satisfaction
the new settlers who arrived at New Castle October 24,
1682. Immediately on his arrival, Penn proceeded to
establish his government over the colony, and the first
assembly was convened at Chester on December 4. This
legislature, in a session of three days, passed laws annexing
the lower counties ceded by the Duke of York to the
province, confirming an act of settlement, and naturalizing
resident foreigners, and also passed in form, after some
revision, the laws which had been prepared in England.</p>

<p>After a visit to Lord Baltimore in his government of
Maryland, Penn returned to <i>Coaquannock</i> (the site of
Philadelphia), and, still conscientiously regarding the Indians
as rightful possessors of the soil, he invited them to a
conference at Shackamaxon (now Kensington), where they
assembled in great numbers. A formal treaty of peace and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
amity was made: the Indians were paid for their lands, and
departed for their homes full of love and admiration for the
great and good <i>Onas</i>, as they called Penn. For seventy
years this simple but sincere treaty remained inviolate: of
it Voltaire says, &#8220;It was the only treaty between these people
and the Christians that was not ratified by an oath, and
which was never broken.&#8221; Certain it is that Penn&#8217;s strict
observance of justice in paying for the soil, and the interest
he manifested, during many successive treaties, in
their real welfare, not only operated to secure the colony
for many years from hostile attacks, but implanted in the
generous though uncultivated mind of the Indian a
regard for Penn and the Quakers which bids fair to be
transmitted to the latest remains of the race.</p>

<p>The capital of the province, Philadelphia, was next to
be laid out, of which at the time of Penn&#8217;s arrival not a
house was completed,&mdash;the colonists having in general no
better lodgings than caves hollowed out of the high banks
of the rivers. The very ground on which it was proposed
to locate was in dispute, being claimed by some Swedes,
who were induced to relinquish their claim for a larger
portion of land elsewhere. The city was located between
<i>Wicacoa</i>, now Southwark, and Shackamaxon,&mdash;two miles
in length and one in breadth, with a navigable river at
each end,&mdash;and was planned with admirable convenience
and regularity under the inspection of the Surveyor-General
of the province. During the first year there
were erected about eighty houses; and the establishment
of various mechanical arts, as well as a profitable trade,
soon gave strength to the infant city.</p>

<p>Early in 1683 the first jury was impanelled for the
trial of one Pickering, with others as accessories, who
were convicted before the governor and council of counterfeiting
the Spanish silver money current in the colony.
The sentence discovers the same spirit of mildness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
equity which at this day constitutes the praise and the
efficacy of the criminal code of the State. He was to pay
a fine of &pound;40 towards the building of a court-house,
standing committed until payment, find securities for his
good behavior, and make restitution in good silver to
the holders of his base coin, <i>which, being first melted down,
was to be restored to him</i>.</p>

<p>Penn&#8217;s interest at court had declined considerably, partly
caused by <i>ambitious</i> enemies; but it was soon restored
upon the death of Charles II. by the accession of his more
immediate patron, James II., which occurred shortly after
Penn&#8217;s arrival in England in 1684. The troubles in that
country during the reign of James involved Penn and his
colony in difficulty, and after the revolution of 1688, which
placed William and Mary on the throne, Penn was several
times imprisoned in consequence of his religion and his
supposed adherence to the cause of the fallen monarch.</p>

<p>On the prevalence of his enemies at court, he had been
deprived of his government of Pennsylvania, which was
annexed in October, 1692, to that of New York under
Colonel Fletcher.</p>

<p>The suspicions which had so long rendered the king
unfriendly to Penn were at last removed. He was honorably
acquitted of all charges, religious as well as political,
which had been brought against him, and his rights were
restored to him by an instrument of William and Mary,
dated in August, 1694.</p>

<p>We have given this little sketch of the history of Pennsylvania
simply as an episode. It is, however, connected
with that portion of our subject which laid the foundation
for a system of communication that has, ever since the
introduction of trade and commerce, made up one of their
chief facilities in business, and identified itself with the
cabinet of Washington,&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT</span>.</p>

<p>In connection with William Penn our readers will no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
doubt be interested in the following letter, which is on file
in the Land Department at the Capitol, in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>According to the &#8220;Harrisburg Telegraph,&#8221; it appears to
be the credentials of a Society of Free-Traders, an organized
body of merchants which once existed in London,
whose objects were to trade with Canada, at that time a
comparatively unknown country. The &#8220;Emperor of
Canada&#8221; was supposed by the company to be a celebrated
Indian chief. The letter is written on a piece of parchment
about two and a half feet wide by three feet in length.
The letters are about an inch in length, slightly inclined
to the right, bold, and of a very symmetrical formation.
The first letters of the first and second lines are large and
highly ornamented,&mdash;a style which is yet kept by some of
our first-class publishers, who introduce ornamental initial
letters to chapters in their books. The signature of Penn
is nearly an inch long, with the same inclination to the
right, but the letters are not quite so bold and gracefully
formed as those in the body of the document:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To the Emperor of Canada</span>:&mdash;The Great God that
made thee and me and all the world, Incline our hearts to
love peace and Justice that we may live friendly together
as becomes the workmanship of the Great God. The
King of England, who is a Great Prince, hath for divers
Reasons, granted me a large Country in America, which
however I am willing to Injoy upon friendly terms with
Thee. And this I will say that the people who come
with me are a just, plain and honest people, that neither
make war upon others nor fear war from others, because
they are just. I have set up a Society of Traders in my
Province to traffic with thee and thy people for your commodities,
that you may be furnished with that which is
good at reasonable rates. And the Society hath ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
their President to treat with thee about a future Trade,
and have joined with me to send this messenger with certain
presents from us to testify our willingness to have
a fair Correspondence with thee. And what this Agent
shall do in our names we will agree unto. I hope thou
wilt Kindly Receive him, and comply with his desires on
our behalf both with respect to Land and Trade. The
Great God be with thee. Amen.</p>

<b>Philadelphia Post-Office&mdash;Posts, etc.</b></h2>

<p class="small">&#8220;Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia, <i>Philadelphia is still erect,
a column in a scene of ruins</i>, a pleasing example that the paths of honor and
safety may sometimes be the same.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gibbon.</span></p>

<p>We purposely passed over Pennsylvania in giving a
statistical account of post-offices, as we intend to make the
Philadelphia post-office the starting-point of a more
general history, as far as the State is concerned, as also a
more extended notice of the system of the general postal
department. Again, there are more historical and remarkable
events associated with Pennsylvania, in connection
with the Revolution, than any other State in the Union.</p>

<p>The history of any one post-office after the Revolution
would be a history of all; and, as the writer is more familiar
with that of Philadelphia, he is enabled to gather more
materials for the miscellaneous portion of his work than
if he had selected any other.</p>

<p>The general business routine of one office differs very
little from that of another: yet every office has its &#8220;unwritten
history&#8221; and its own &#8220;romance and realities.&#8221;</p>

<p>New York, with its vast commercial interests both at
home and abroad, and justly termed the metropolis of
America, could, from the archives of her post-office, give
to the world incidents that perhaps would find no parallel
in the annals of all the calendars that have registered
events of a startling character since the creation of the
world.</p>

<p>A post-office, with its millions of letters, is an epitomized
world. The letters represent the human race, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
contain the written records of their vices and virtues; or
it may be compared to a huge volume, and the letters
passing to and fro, the indexes to its contents.</p>

<p>Not that the secrets of a post-office become known to
its officers by improper means, but by that process of
secret modes of detection whose mysterious workings are
unknown to those unconnected with the institution. Very
little behind the great city we have named stands that of
Philadelphia; and its post-office, like the tomb, has buried
secrets which an &#8220;Old Mortality&#8221; alone has the power to
bring forth. The task be ours to paint the mysteries of
the postal tomb.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE ROMANCE OF THE POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>History and romance have, as it were, by mutual consent
allied themselves together for the sole purpose of
mystifying mankind. It is true the first cannot pervert
a living fact, but it can materially affect the character of
one long since passed away and mingled with the revolution
of words, men, and nations. The latter is simply a
colorist: the one maps, the other paints. And yet how
often do we hear it said that truth is stranger than fiction!
The romance of a post-office would be a far more truthful
history of the human heart than any other work ever
written upon the subject. The post-office is the pulsation
of a nation, the beating of a million of hearts, and
its records would be the world&#8217;s volume. &#8220;A mail-bag,&#8221;
says a writer, &#8220;is an epitome of human life. All
the elements which go to form the happiness or misery of
individuals&mdash;the raw material, so to speak, of human
hopes and fears&mdash;here exist in a chaotic state. These
elements are imprisoned, like the winds in the fabled cave
of &AElig;olus, &#8216;biding their time&#8217; to go forth and fulfil their
office, whether it be to refresh and invigorate the drooping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
flower, or to bring destruction upon the proud and stately
forest king.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>We have selected the Philadelphia post-office as the
scene of our romantic portion of this work, because, as
stated, it is familiar to us, and many of the incidents,
anecdotes, &amp;c. related came under our immediate notice.
We mention this simply to do away with any impression
that may arise that our purpose was to exalt one city over
another and praise its institutions at the expense of those
of other places. The author having received some little
credit as a critic in another department of our literature
for impartiality at least, it is hoped that he will not be
accused of a departure from it in this instance.</p>

<p>The history of Philadelphia is fraught with much interest;
it is identified with the name of one whose mild and
conciliating views with regard to the Indians made his
colonization one of holy peace, and gave to the name
of Philadelphia by Christian practice what its Biblical
meaning conveys,&mdash;&#8220;the City of Brotherly Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>We annex an extract from a Latin poem, inscribed to
James Logan, Esq., by Thomas Makin, dated 1728. It
was found among James Logan&#8217;s papers many years after
his death. The poem seems to have been written for
amusement in his old age:&mdash;</p>

<p>The want of a regular postal system was not felt in the
colonies until they had reached a certain point in trade,
commerce, and population. The mode of conveying letters
and packages, indeed, as well as merchandise of all kinds,
was perfectly simple and of a decided primitive character.</p>

<p>Pack-horses were used for the purpose of conveying
goods from Philadelphia to towns west. Pack-horses
afforded almost the sole means of transportation until
about 1788, when the roads were made accessible for
wagons; and even then, when the first wagon made its
appearance at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the &#8220;packers&#8221; became
greatly excited, and looked upon it as an improvement
likely to &#8220;ruin their trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>The year 1683 was remarkable for the number of emigrants
who arrived in the colony. It was in this year the
first Assembly was held in Philadelphia, and laws enacted
which had a wonderful bearing on the future prospects of
the colony.</p>

<p>In July of this year William Penn issued an order for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the establishing of a post-office, and granted to Henry
Waldy, of Tekonay (now written Tacony), authority to
hold one, and to supply passengers with horses from
Philadelphia to New Castle, or to the Falls. The rates of
postage were as follows: &#8220;Letters from the Falls, 3<i>d.</i>; to
Chester, 5<i>d.</i>; to New Castle, 7<i>d.</i>; to Maryland, 9<i>d.</i>; and
from Philadelphia to Chester, 2<i>d.</i>; to New Castle, 4<i>d.</i>;
and to Maryland, 6<i>d.</i>&#8221; The post went once a week, and
was to be carefully published &#8220;on the meeting-house door
and other public places.&#8221;</p>

<p>There being no other mode of conveyance except by
horse,&mdash;wagons and stages not being then established,&mdash;the
transporting of letters was, of course, made by &#8220;post-horses:&#8221;
these were of the slow order and conducted on
that principle. It was not until 1756 that the first line
of stages was established. The chief office was in Strawberry
Alley, at the sign of the &#8220;Death of the Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stage <i>vi&acirc;</i> Perth Amboy and Trenton made its trip
to New York in three days. John Butler was the proprietor,
he having been set up in the business by the &#8220;Old
Hunting Club,&#8221; to whom Butler had been huntsman and
kennel-keeper. The same year &#8220;British packet-boats&#8221; were
first announced between New York and Falmouth. In
1765 a second line of stages was set up for New York, to
start twice a week, using three days in going through, at
twopence a mile. It was a covered Jersey wagon, without
springs, and had four owners or proprietors concerned in
its management. The same year the first line of stages,
vessels, and wagons is set up from Philadelphia to Baltimore
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Christiana and Frenchtown on Elk River, to go
once a week from Philadelphia. In 1766 a third line of
new stages for New York, modestly called the &#8220;Flying
Machine,&#8221; and intended, of course, to beat the two former
ones, was set up to go through in two days,&mdash;to start from
Elm Street, near Vine Street, under the ownership of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
John Barnhill. They were to be &#8220;good stage wagons, and
the seats set on springs.&#8221; Fare, threepence per mile, or
twenty shillings for the whole route. In the winter season,
however, the &#8220;Flying Machine&#8221; was to cleave to the rough
roads for three days, as in former times.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;Weekly Mercury&#8221; of March 8, 1759, we find
the following quaint advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f8">&#8220;PHILADELPHIA STAGE WAGGON AND NEW YORK STAGE BOAT<br /><br />

&#8220;<i>performs their stages twice a week</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Butler with his waggon, sets out on Mondays
from his house at the sign of the Death of the Fox, in
Strawberry Ally, and drives the same day to Trenton
Ferry, when Francis Holman meets him, and proceeds on
Tuesday to Brunswick, and the passengers and goods
being shifted into the waggon of Isaac Fitzrandolph, he
takes them to the New Blazing Star to Jacob Fitzrandolph&#8217;s
the same day, where Rubin Fitzrandolph, with a
boat well suted, will receive them and take them to New
York that night. John Butler returning to Philadelphia
on Tuesday with the passengers and goods delivered to
him by Francis Holman, will again set out for Trenton
Ferry on Thursday and Francis Holman &amp;c. will carry
his passengers and goods, with the same expedition as
above to New York.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;March 8, 1759.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;In 1773, as perfection advanced, Messrs. C. Bessonett
&amp; Co., of Bristol,&#8221; start stage-coaches&mdash;being the first of
that character&mdash;to run from Philadelphia to New York in
two days, for the fare of $4. At the same time &#8220;outside
passengers&#8221; were to pay 20 shillings each.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>In 1785 the legislature of New York passed an act of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
exclusive privilege for ten years to Isaac Vanwick and
others to run a four-horse stage from New York to
Albany at fourpence a mile. This to encourage the experiment.</p>

<p>It would be a curious history to follow up that of stage-coaches
until the introduction of railroads and steamboats.
It would be a history fraught not only with interest, but
showing the enterprise of men under a new mode of government,
and the developing of minds which under
monarchical rule were chained as it were to ignorance and
fanaticism. Liberty and that freedom a republican system
gives both to mind and body create a desire</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;To learn and know the truth of every thing</div>
<div class="line i0">Which is co-natural and born with it,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>We have stated that Butler was the &#8220;kennel-keeper&#8221; to
the Old Hunting Club. This club was composed of the
&#8220;first men of the day.&#8221; The kennel for the hounds belonging
to the company was situated on the brow of the hill
north of Callowhill Street, descending to Pegg&#8217;s Run, near
Second Street. Butler lived in a low brick house adjoining
the northwest corner of Callowhill and Second Streets.
Fox-hunting was a favorite amusement of the club. When
the population of the city increased and game disappeared,
the members removed their establishment over to Gloucester,
so as to make their hunts in the Jersey pines.</p>

<p>The passion for hunting led to other amusements not
quite so interesting or innocent, both as regarded their
character and the influence they were calculated to have
on society. These were horse-racing and bull-baiting.
The latter were frequent, more particularly in the Northern
Liberties, and were first supported chiefly by butchers, but
gradually assumed a more aristocratical character, being
encouraged by many members of the &#8220;Old Hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Club.&#8221; John Ord, an Englishman, kept bull-dogs for
the purpose of the breed. His establishment was at the
corner of Second and High Streets. The cruel amusement
of bull-baiting&mdash;one which gave to Old Spain a
character for cruelty only equalled by that of the Inquisition&mdash;continued
until about 1798, when Robert Wharton,
Esq., was elected mayor of the city. He attended one of
these &#8220;bull-baits,&#8221; and actually, just as they were about to
loose the dogs, jumped into the ring, and, calling aloud,
said he would arrest the first man who should commence
the cruel work. The effect was tremendous: men started
back in affright; the very dogs cowed beneath the glance
of his flashing eyes; and the bull gave a roar,&mdash;no doubt
one of rejoicing for his escape. There were no more bull-baitings
after that.</p>

<p>William Penn did not enter upon his mission in the
colonies unprepared for all the difficulties he had to encounter,
nor was he ignorant of the history of those
nations and their great cities which ages ago gave them a
classic habitation and a home.</p>

<p>Penn evidently had the celebrated city of Babylon in
view as a model for Philadelphia; and, from a draft before
us, the idea, as far as regularity and order were concerned,
appears to have been well conceived, and, as proved, subsequently
carried out.</p>

<p>The history of Philadelphia, as it was during its colonial,
caterpillar state, and as it is now in dazzling, butterfly
beauty under a far different system of government, is
familiar to all: yet we shall have occasion, in connection
with our subject, to allude to its former history as we
proceed.</p>

<p>The post-office scheme of Colonel John Hamilton was
well adapted to the wants of the colonists. In 1717 a
settled post was established from Virginia to Maryland,
which went through all the Northern colonies, bringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
and forwarding letters from Boston to Williamsburg, in
Virginia, in four weeks.</p>

<p>In 1727 the mail to Annapolis was opened, to go once
a fortnight in summer, and once a month in winter, <i>vi&acirc;</i>
New Castle, &amp;c., to the Western Shore, and back to the
Eastern Shore, managed by William Bradford in Philadelphia,
and by William Parks, of Annapolis.</p>

<p>William Bradford established a press in Philadelphia
in 1687, the first-fruits of which was a sheet almanac.
The title was, &#8220;An Almanac for the Year of the Christian
Era 1687; particularly respecting the meridian and
latitude of Burlington, but may indifferently suit all places
adjacent. By William Leeds, Student in Agriculture.
Printed and Sold by William Bradford, near Philadelphia,
in Pennsylvania.&#8221;</p>

<p>A copy of this rare print is in the Philadelphia Library.</p>

<p>William Bradford was the then deputy postmaster, but,
having proved negligent respecting his official accounts,
was removed, and Benjamin Franklin was appointed in
his stead. Colonel Spottswood was the postmaster-general,
at whose instigation Bradford was removed.</p>

<p>Now commenced a new and important era in the postal
department of our country, bearing date 1737. It was
at that period, however, a very unimportant matter, but in
time has become a gigantic institution. We look back to
that period now with more interest, for two reasons: one
is, to contrast it with the present, and the other, because
the name of Benjamin Franklin is identified with the first
great move in our postal history.</p>

<p>Franklin assumed the deputy-postmastership in 1737.
The only pecuniary available result from it, however, was
that it afforded him better facilities for procuring news
for his paper, and for its distribution. This paper was
originally entitled &#8220;The Universal Instructor in all Arts
and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette,&#8221; and had reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
its thirty-ninth number when its proprietor sold out to
Franklin and Meredith. October 2, 1729, was the date
of No. 40, edited by B. Franklin. It was reduced in
name to &#8220;Pennsylvania Gazette.&#8221; The increase and emoluments
of his paper were still further aided by the diminishing
patronage received by his rival Bradford, the displaced
postmaster, who had while in office forbidden his post-riders
to distribute any papers but his own. Franklin,
speaking of this ungenerous conduct on the part of Bradford,
said, &#8220;I thought so meanly of the practice on his
part, that when I afterwards came into the situation I
took care never to imitate it.&#8221; He also says, in his Life,
&#8220;Thus Bradford suffered greatly from his neglect in due
accounting; and I mention this fact as a lesson to those
young men who may be employed in managing affairs for
others, that they should always render accounts and make
remittances with great clearness and punctuality, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no portion of our postal history more
interesting than that which characterized its early dawn.
It presents a sort of political and financial struggle between
trade, commerce, and a government. Franklin, however,
settled the question by making it both a national and commercial
feature. It is also interesting to note the difference
between the movements of the public mail in those old
colonial days, when its bags, at most but a few score
pounds in weight, were almost universally carried on horseback,
and in these times, when it is speeded in tons by
steam!</p>

<p>Perhaps there was not another man in the colonies
better adapted for the postmastership than Franklin. He
had been, up to that period, an active business-man. He
was a printer, editor, compositor, publisher, bookseller,
and stationer,&mdash;in fact, a modern Faust in the first, and a
Mathew Carey in the latter.</p>

<p>The postal services of the colonies now began to assume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
a somewhat business form, and, although some of these
services were not immediately connected with the department,
they were nevertheless highly advantageous to the
community: as, for instance, letters arriving from beyond
sea were usually delivered on board the ship into the
hands of the persons to whom they were addressed;
families expecting letters would send a messenger on board
for the purpose of receiving letters. Those that were not
called for before the sailing of the vessel were taken to
the &#8220;Coffee-House,&#8221; where everybody could make inquiry
for them; thus showing that the post-office did not seem
to claim a right to distribute them, as now. Persons
coming from adjacent settlements called at the &#8220;Coffee-House,&#8221;
and carried away not only their own letters, but
all those belonging to their neighborhood. These were
called &#8220;neighborly posts.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the trade of the colonies extended, the system of
letter-delivery began to vary; and thus the &#8220;neighborly
post&#8221; system resolved itself into that of the &#8220;post-rider.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Boston deserves the credit of the first formation
of a foreign postal system; for in 1639 the General Court
of Massachusetts issued the following decree:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tb">&#8220;It is ordered that notice be given that Richard Fairbanks
his house in Boston is the place appointed for all
letters which are brought from beyond the seas, or are to
be sent thither to be left with him; and he is to take care
that they are to be delivered or sent accordingly to the
directions; and he is allowed for every letter a penny; and
he must answer all miscarriages through his own neglect in
this kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, the Old Coffee-House system prevailed
for many years.</p>

<p>In Virginia, the mail-bag was passed along from plantation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to plantation, and each planter was required by law,
passed in 1757, to send a messenger with it to his next
neighbor, under a penalty of a hogshead of tobacco. Every
man took out his own letters from the bag, and so on to
the remainder.</p>

<p>In 1672 the government of New York established a
monthly mail to Boston, advertising that those disposed
to send letters should bring them to the secretary&#8217;s office,
where, in a &#8220;locket-box,&#8221; they shall be preserved till the
messenger calls for them; all persons paying the post
before the &#8220;bagg be sealed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1692 the office of postmaster-general for North America
was created; but as late as 1704 no post-rider went
farther east than Boston, or farther south than Baltimore.
When Franklin was appointed postmaster-general, in 1753,
the line of posts still began at Boston, and went no farther
south than Charleston.</p>

<p>In 1738 Henry Pratt was made riding-postmaster for
all the stages between Philadelphia and Newport, Virginia,
&#8220;<i>to set out in the beginning of each month, and to
return in twenty-four days. To him all merchants, &amp;c.
may confide their letters and other business, he having given
security to the postmaster-general.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1744 it was announced in the Gazette that the
&#8220;Northern post begins his fortnight stages on Tuesday
next for the winter season.&#8221; In 1745 John Dalley, Surveyor
of the State, says that he has just made survey of
the road from Trenton to Amboy, and has set up marks
at every two miles to guide the traveller!</p>

<p>An attempt was made in 1692 to establish post-routes
throughout Virginia. A patent was laid before the Virginia
Assembly for making a Mr. Neal postmaster-general
of that and other parts of America; but though the
Assembly passed an act in favor of this patent, it had no
effect. The reason assigned was that it was impossible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
carry it into execution, on account of the dispersed situations
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The locality of the colonial post-offices is a matter of
doubt; but, as nearly all the public departments were
located in private houses, the presumption is that the
post-office was, under Bradford, at his printing-office, and
it is more than probable that Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s residence,
corner of Second and Race, was, or at least a portion
of it, used for postal purposes. The first located building
used for the purpose was on the east side of Water Street,
a few doors below High Street,&mdash;the same house which
had before been the residence of the chief justice.</p>

<p>It is evident from the old records that all along Water
Street and Front Street, extending to South, the chief
business of the city was transacted. The earliest papers
show by their advertisements that many of the goods for
retail were sold on Water Street. Even Penn Street at
that early period was of some note; and there are to this
day many buildings in its immediate vicinity which bear
date prior to 1750. As early as 1737 Mrs. Fishbourne
kept a store in Water Street below Walnut, expressly for
&#8220;ladies&#8217; goods.&#8221; In Water Street above Pine Street, in
1755, there was a fashionable furnishing-store for gentlemen&#8217;s
wearing apparel. The &#8220;Old London Coffee-House&#8221;
stood at the corner of Front and Market Streets: it was
the resort of merchants and the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the city.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> All that
portion of Front and Second Streets extending as far down
as Almond was termed &#8220;Society Hill,&#8221; and was the nucleus
around and near which the tradesmen, the milliners,
mantuamakers, and retail merchants gathered.</p>

<p>William Penn, Jr., had a small house at the corner of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Second and South Streets. The scenery in the neighborhood
of Second and Dock Streets is described by old historians
as being very beautiful. Watson says, &#8220;Looking
across the &#8216;Dock Creek,&#8217; westward, we see all the margin
of the creek adorned with every grace of shrubbery and
foliage; and beyond it a gently sloping descent from the
line of Second Street, whereon were hutted a few of the
natives&#8217; wigwams, intermixed among the shadowy trees.
A bower near there, and a line of deeper verdure on the
ground, marked &#8216;the Spring,&#8217; where the naiad weeps her
emptying urn.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Union and Front Streets,
&#8220;Alderman Plumstead&#8221; had a splendid garden on the
&#8220;Sloping Hill:&#8221; it was the admiration of the town. In
1739 the Rev. George Whitefield preached to fifteen thousand
people on &#8220;Society Hill,&#8221; near to the flag-staff near
Front and Pine. There was also a place of resort in this
vicinity, called &#8220;Cherry Garden.&#8221; &#8220;The Friends&#8217; Meeting-House&#8221;
was also located here, and &#8220;George Wells&#8217;s
place&#8221; was much admired. The Loxley House, which
stood back of 177 South Second Street (old number),
below Little Dock, and only within a few years torn down,
is well known for its historical reminiscences to our
readers. Near to the Loxley House there was a peculiar
spring of water, called &#8220;Bathsheba&#8217;s Spring and Bower.&#8221;
The origin of the name is somewhat curious. &#8220;Bathsheba
Bowers&#8221; was the name of a young lady. She
erected a small house near to the best spring of water that
was in our city. The house she furnished with books, a
table, and a cup, in which she, or any that visited her,
drank of the spring. Some people gave it the name of
&#8220;Bathsheba&#8217;s Bower,&#8221; and the spring long afterwards bore
the name of &#8220;Bathsheba&#8217;s Spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in the immediate vicinity of this then beautiful
portion of the city the first theatre was opened.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps there are many of our readers unacquainted
with the early history of the stage and the drama in
Philadelphia. True, much has been written upon the subject;
but in almost every instance discrepancies both in
dates and names have occurred.</p>

<p>In the year 1747, one hundred and nineteen years ago,
a company of comedians were performing in this city.
As this announcement will no doubt startle many, we
must, as pioneers in the cause of truth and the drama, be
chronological as well as logical in establishing the fact.</p>

<p>The state of society at the period alluded to above was
different from what it is now. A feeble, sickly spirit of
aristocracy, even at that early stage of our history, disgraced
alike the moral and intellectual character of those
who caught the infection; and hence a bitter feeling existed
among the various classes making up the great body politic.
This dangerous foe to all social and religious forms was
brought over to the colonies by a few decayed branches
of the nobility-trees of England, who had established
a sort of &#8220;West End&#8221; fraternity along Front Street below
Spruce (in the immediate vicinity of the Loxley House),
and which was known for many years as Society Hill.
Broad lines of distinction were drawn between the classes,
and mechanics were looked upon as being so far beneath
the consideration of these &#8220;Malaprops&#8221; of real life that
servants had to negotiate all business transactions: <i>the
quality had nothing to do with them</i>!</p>

<p>In the principal streets, such as Second, Front, Spruce,
and even as far down as South Street, various artisans,
shopkeepers, and others had established themselves in
business; and it was here the first attempt was made
to enact plays and lay the foundation of the drama&#8217;s
temple.</p>

<p>The Quakers, and the more sober portion of other denominations,
left no means untried to break up what they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
termed &#8220;these Satan-like doings.&#8221; It is true, these exhibitions
were not publicly announced, and the citizens
generally were not aware of their secret place of exhibiting
&#8220;profane plays.&#8221; Private as they were, however, sufficient
publicity was given to them to create an alarm
among a class of people possessing all the primitive qualities,
as well as virtues, of their great founder.</p>

<p>The dawn of literature in this country (<i>that is, admitting
it ever had a morning</i>) dates at a much later period than
the year 1747. It is true many obstacles stood in the
way of its advancement; apart from which, the colonists
were not a reading community, and the press throughout
the land might be likened unto &#8220;angels&#8217; visits, few and
far between.&#8221; It is true the colonists could boast of a
few names, whose works bear date as far back as 1640.
In 1639 manuscripts were used in courts. The laws by
which the colonies were governed were not printed until
1641. The art of printing was introduced into North
America in 1639. The first printing-press established in
the States was put up at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in
1639, by Stephen Day. In 1640 he published the Bay
Psalm-Book. The year 1678 may be said to form an era
in our literature; for at that time John Foster, Boston,
published the works of Anne Bradstreet; in 1676, Peter
Folger wrote and published his famous &#8220;Looking-Glass
for the Times.&#8221; Various poems, orations, sermons, &amp;c.
&amp;c., were published; but it was not until 1720 the <i>first
play was written on the American continent</i>; and we deem
it of sufficient importance to engross it in our sketch of
the American stage.</p>

<p>Benjamin Coleman, or, as some wrote it, Colman, was
born in Boston, October 19, 1676. While at Harvard
College, he wrote the tragedy of &#8220;Gustavus Vasa;&#8221; and
this was the first play enacted by a company of amateurs
in the colonies. The history of our literature is associated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
with that of the press: without the press it would have
been as learning was when vellum and beech received
the impression of certain figures called letters, and were
sold at enormous prices, in proportion to the intellectual
and physical labor bestowed upon their productions. The
moment the press was put in operation in Connecticut,
poetry, Pallas-like, sprang from its mystic womb, and, if
unlike Pallas, completely armed, was at least so decently
clad that criticism faltered at the threshold of censure.
The next play written and the first published in the colonies
was &#8220;The Prince of Parthia,&#8221; by Thomas Godfrey:
it was printed in 1768. A copy of it is in the Philadelphia
Library. This author was the son of Thomas Godfrey,
a glazier, and inventor of the celebrated quadrant now in
use. He was born in Philadelphia, in the year 1736.
We never refer to these pioneers in the cause of our drama
and literature without feeling a desire to moralize. Indeed,
to look back over a series of years, and call up
images to the mind which have long since passed away,
strikes so forcibly the conviction of man&#8217;s identity with
the infinite works of God, that he trembles, while he
meditates, and feels his own insignificance while mourning
o&#8217;er &#8220;visions fled.&#8221;</p>

<p>They are brought up to our view by the &#8220;Old Mortalities&#8221;
of every generation; and the selfsame enthusiastic
feeling which prompted them to remember coming ages
urges us to fulfil our destiny in this. It would be curious
to us in this generation, if it were possible, to raise up the
curtain of the mouldering past and bring to view &#8220;the
things that were,&#8221;&mdash;paint the lowly dwellings of our
ancestors, the simplicity and primitive qualities of their
minds, and the stern moral rectitude of their even lives.
All this would contrast fearfully with what we are now,
not only as regards our temporal but our spiritual state.
If we differ from our good old friends of the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
century, it is on the subject of the drama and the strange
notion they had of its immoral tendency; for we never
could imagine that the choicest gems from the British
poets&mdash;conveyed to us through the medium of the stage&mdash;could
have any other effect than to exalt the mind, expand
the intellect, and open to the view the rich and inexhaustible
mental wealth of the mimic world. It would be
curious, we say, if it were possible to describe that state
of society which could exist without <i>music</i>, <i>poetry</i>, and
<i>painting</i>,&mdash;a state of society no doubt perfectly moral,
strictly pure, but rather stiffly starched with the old-fashioned
notions of propriety and the right of enjoyment.
At that period, dancing was prohibited, and a fencing-master
from Paris almost hunted down for attempting to
teach the art in this city. It is true, a few wax figures
and Punch and Judy made their appearance on some
holidays; but they soon <i>melted</i> away before the heat of puritanical
sunshine.</p>

<p>We now come to the first attempt at theatrical representations.
In the year 1747 a company was formed, composed
chiefly of young men whose education and birth
placed them in positions to advance the cause of science or
art, as their tastes and inclinations might have led them to
advocate. A family by the name of Courtland, an English
family, had but recently arrived in this country, and,
possessing many of the prevailing notions at that time
popular in England, their astonishment at our total ignorance
of the drama and its literature was fully shown by
a display of their knowledge and a familiar acquaintance
with the living dramatists of that period in England. It
is not our purpose to connect the name of Courtland with
the organization of this company: indeed, such a thing
would be almost impossible, inasmuch as the association
was as secret as were the names of its members. One
thing, however, was evident: a taste for dramatic reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
soon became prevalent, and the plays of Shakspeare found
favor even in the eyes of the godly. Young Courtland,
the leader of &#8220;Society Hill&#8221; boys, soon inoculated his
companions with many of their follies, and the playgrounds
about the Loxley House resounded with their
shouts. From this circle came forth the pioneers of our
drama. A companion of Courtland&#8217;s, by the name of
Aitken, was the first to propose a dramatic association.
The name of Garrick and the uprising of the English
drama in London had already enlisted many here in its
favor.</p>

<p>The place of meeting for the early pioneership of the
drama was held in a house on Second Street adjoining the
then gardens of the Loxley House, and immediately connected
with an old white building, recently altered into
stores, and which was used in our Revolutionary War as
a hospital. The front portion of this dramatic temple
was used as a boot and shoe store; the rear was occupied
by the proprietor&#8217;s family, and the range of rooms over
the back building was the scene of the drama&#8217;s birth. It
was here &#8220;Richard III.&#8221; was enacted, and it was here the
few plays that had crossed the Atlantic found favor in the
eyes of the aspirants for histrionic fame, and whose dramatic
efforts kindled a flame in many a youthful breast,
which has sent its light down through the mimic world
to brighten it in all ages.</p>

<p>A great sensation was created by this theatrical outbreak,
and on its reaching the ears of the Quakers, they,
with others opposed to such &#8220;unlawful proceedings and
profane exhibitions,&#8221; had the matter brought before the
council, or, rather, the recorder, and we find upon his
office-books, bearing date January 8, 1749, gravely written,
&#8220;The recorder then acquainted the board that certain
persons had taken upon them to act plays in this city, and,
as he was informed, intended to make a frequent practice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
thereof, which it was feared would be attended with
mischievous effect, such as the encouraging of idleness,
and drawing great sums of money from weak and inconsiderate
people, who are apt to be fond of such kinds of
entertainments, though the performance be ever so mean
and contemptible. Whereupon the board unanimously
requested the magistrates to take most effectual measures
for suppressing this disorder, by sending for the actors
and binding them to their good behavior, or by such other
means as they should judge most proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proceeding, strange as it may seem, produced quite
a contrary effect; for the company, which was now regularly
organized, and was made subservient to the interests
of all concerned, actually stepped out from behind the law
and boldly asked permission from the authorities to enact
plays in some more public place other than the obscure
spot they had selected. Backed by the aristocracy of
&#8220;Society Hill,&#8221; their application was granted.</p>

<p>What aided to strengthen this company and give it
character was the fact of several members of a West India
company arriving here, who immediately joined them; and
thus Richard III., Hamlet, Beau Stratagem, &amp;c., were
played in a manner to please the &#8220;million.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Philadelphia company left the Quaker City at the
close of 1749, and opened a temporary theatre in a wooden
building in Nassau Street, New York. A writer, alluding
to this company and the early history of the drama, says,
&#8220;The earliest theatrical performances, in the recollection
of the oldest inhabitants, were in a store on Crugar&#8217;s
wharf, near Old Slip, by a company of Thespians, composed
of &#8216;choice spirits&#8217; of a certain order. They were
roystering young men, full of tricks and mischief, who
used to play cricket in the fields, and who spent their
nights at the Boat-House, on Broad Street, near where the
United States Public Stores now stand.&#8221; Our readers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
will recognize in these young men the Thespian company
from the Quaker City. After playing here with some
success, the company left for Virginia.</p>

<p>They then went to Williamsburg, Virginia, and, although
William Dunlap denies the fact in his &#8220;History
of the American Stage,&#8221; yet it is true that under the
presidency of Thomas Lee the Philadelphia company,
strengthened by the addition made to it in New York,
obtained permission to erect a theatre in Williamsburg,
and in the year 1750 it was begun and finished. They
played here in 1751.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Hallam opened at this very theatre on the 5th of September,
1752, and on the evening of July 13, 1752, the
Philadelphia and New York company opened their second
new theatre in Annapolis, and performed &#8220;The Beau
Stratagem&#8221; and the farce of &#8220;The Virgin Unmasked:&#8221;
boxes, 10<i>s.</i>; pit, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Richard III. was performed
twice,&mdash;the character of Richard by Mr. Wynel, and that
of Richmond by Mr. Herbert. Mr. Eyniason, Mr. Aitken,
and Mr. Courtland are the only names handed down to us
as belonging to the colonial company.</p>

<p>As Hallam&#8217;s company arrived at Yorktown in June,
1752, and did not open until September at Williamsburg,
there is no doubt that a portion of his company joined
Eyniason at Annapolis and played until the opening at
Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The first play, therefore, acted in this country by what
may be termed a regular company (and this company
was composed of the old actors, and two or three of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Hallam&#8217;s, viz.: Wynel and Herbert) was &#8220;The Beau
Stratagem,&#8221; and the farce of &#8220;The Virgin Unmasked.&#8221;
After the organization of Hallam&#8217;s company the members
of the old became incorporated with it. The Annapolis
theatre, which in 1752 was called the New Theatre, was
built of brick, and was calculated to hold over five hundred
persons. Dunlap says <i>this was the first theatre erected
in this country</i>, not being advised of the one erected in
Williamsburg in 1750. In justice, however, to Dunlap,
the author has a letter from the veteran of the drama
within a short time before his death, wherein he acknowledges
his error and does justice to Burke the historian,
and admits the justice of our correction made in the year
1835.</p>

<p>The following are the names of a portion of the company
who played in the &#8220;The Beau Stratagem:&#8221;&mdash;Mr.
Eyniason, Mr. Bell, Mr. Miller, Mr. Love, Mr. Courtney,
Mr. Aitken, Mrs. Love, and Mrs. Becceley. These
we have every reason to believe were of the old company.</p>

<p>After playing here for a while under circumstances by
no means pleasing, the manager cast his eyes to the principal
cities of the country, and selected New York as the
first step towards the establishing of the drama among the
<i>&eacute;lite</i>. At that period the <i>first families</i> in Virginia had not
assumed that prerogative. Hallam opened his first place
of amusement in the city of New York on the 17th day
of September, 1753, with &#8220;Conscious Lovers,&#8221; and &#8220;Damon
and Phillida.&#8221; The site was originally occupied by
the old Dutch Church on Nassau Street. As a matter of

<p class="center"><i>THE PHILADELPHIA STAGE.</i></p>

<p>The Nassau Street, New York, closed on the 18th of
March, 1754, and Hallam accepted a pressing invitation
from a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia, and opened
on the 15th of April, 1754, in a sail-loft or warehouse
belonging to William Plumstead, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> situated in Water
Street, southeast corner of the first alley above Pine. This
building extended to the wharf. This was certainly a
most curious locality: yet at that period the neighborhood
of its site was almost <i>aristocratical</i>, for &#8220;Society Hill,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
extending all along Front Street to Almond, was the
theatre of as much fashionable parade and display as
Chestnut Street is now. There stood at that period several
finely-built houses, and its proximity to the &#8220;Loxley
House&#8221; and &#8220;White Hall&#8221; gave it a character it certainly
could not claim at the present day: we mean, of course,
for its locality as a theatre. There is also another, and
perhaps a paramount one; and that is, it was the only
place they could get. It was here, on this lone spot, the
first regular company of comedians opened their Philadelphia
campaign. The play was the &#8220;Fair Penitent,&#8221; and
&#8220;Miss in her Teens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having given an account of the first theatrical exhibition
given in this city, and the site of the first theatre, we
come now to the second, which may, in fact, be termed the
first erected for legitimate purposes. The company continued
to play at Plumstead&#8217;s warehouse, gaining favor
gradually with the public, until June, having remained
open two months, and playing to crowded houses. On
the 17th of June they played &#8220;The Careless Husband&#8221;
by particular request, the proceeds of which were appropriated
to the poor of the city. It is a curious fact in the
history of the drama, and one which reflects but little
credit upon its opponents, that in almost every case of
opposition the belligerent parties were bought over by
<i>money</i>, and even this came into their hands as <i>donations to</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
<i>the poor</i>; but whether the poor ever received a penny of
it is a matter time and eternity have already reconciled.
Even at the present day there are classes of men whose
opinion of actors and theatres would undergo a <i>material</i>
change if a portion of the proceeds of the theatrical representations
were poured into their laps, and used, as the
phrase goes, <i>for the poor</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1759 David Douglas opened the second
theatre in Philadelphia. This building stood at the southwest
corner of South and Vernon Streets. It was built
entirely of wood, weather-boarded and painted a dark lead-color.
It was a large building, and calculated to hold a
thousand persons. Douglas had succeeded to the throne
of the &#8220;mimic world&#8221; in consequence of the death of Mr.
Hallam, whose widow he married. Douglas was a man
of enterprise, and ambitious to establish the regular drama
in the Western World. In the pursuit of this object he
at once determined to erect temples to the histrionic
muses which in after-years would lead to the establishing
of others, whose classic beauty and architectural
design might emulate the proudest edifices of the land
and find their model in Roman superstructure. In doing
this, he had to contend against the prejudices of the people,
and select such plays as were calculated to disarm opposition
and enlist the liberal in his favor. Thus, he
opened the old South Street Theatre with the tragedy of
&#8220;Douglass,&#8221; written, as was stated in the bills, by Mr.
Home, minister of the Kirk of Scotland. This was followed
by &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221; which play, it was said, furnished a
moral lesson for youth and the regulation of their conduct
through life. On the 27th of December a benefit was
given towards raising a fund for &#8220;purchasing an organ to
the college hall in this city, and instructing the charity
children in psalmody.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>
<p>On the following evening &#8220;Hamlet&#8221; was played for
the benefit of the Pennsylvania Hospital, and the theatre
closed for the season. The members of the company&mdash;at
least the chief portion&mdash;were Mr. and Mrs. Douglas, Miss
Cheer, Mrs. Morris,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Mrs. Crane, Mrs. Allyn, and Miss
Hallam. In addition to the company which we have
already mentioned in another chapter, we find the names
of Quelch, Tomlinson, Stuart, Tremaine, Reed, and Morris.</p>

<p>Francis Mentges, afterwards an officer in our service,
was the dancing performer. While he danced he assumed
the name of Francis. Miss Cheer was the <i>Lady Macbeth</i>
of the day, and Morris, the husband of the lady whose
unfortunate fate we have stated, was the low comedian:
his name is to be found in various companies, enacting old
men, up to as late a period as 1800. Dunlap says, &#8220;Those
that can look back to 1788 will remember him as a little,
shrivelled old man, with a voice palsied with age, having
for his second wife a tall, elegant woman, the favorite
comedy lady, and the admiration of the public.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Synod, in July, 1759, formally addressed
the governor and legislature to prevent the opening.
The Friends made their application to Judge William
Allen to suppress the representations. His reply was
that &#8220;he had got more moral virtue from plays than he
had from sermons.&#8221; As a sequel, it was long remembered
and spoken of, that the night the theatre opened, and on
which he intended to visit, <i>he was called to mourn the
death of his wife</i>! The motto over the stage was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f9">Totus mundis agit histrionem.</p>

<p>There are many persons who confound this with the
third theatre, erected by Douglas. That no further doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
may exist upon its site, three brick buildings are situated,
as stated, at the southwest corner of South and Vernon
Streets.</p>

<p>Society Hill, which extended from Spruce Street (gradually
rising, having its summit on Pine Street) to the
Swedes&#8217; Church, was the fashionable portion of the city.
At that period they had &#8220;Cherry Garden&#8221; on Society
Hill; the &#8220;Friends&#8217; Meeting-House,&#8221; the &#8220;theatre,&#8221;
&#8220;George Wells&#8217;s place.&#8221; They had also a flag-staff erected
on Society Hill, under which Whitefield preached. This
staff stood at the corner of Pine and Front Streets. Alderman
Plumstead&#8217;s garden was situated in Union Street,
and it was the admiration of the town.</p>

<p>In the year 1724 a slack- and tight-rope exhibition was
given by a company of men and women, at the corner of
South and Front Streets. They continued their antics for
twenty nights to gaping crowds. This was the first exhibition
of the kind ever given in the city.</p>

<p>Douglas, finding the more respectable portion of the
community disposed to encourage theatricals, selected a
more eligible site for the building of another theatre,
and for that purpose fixed on a vacant lot situated at the
southwest corner of South and Apollo Streets, above
Fourth: hence the error of many historians who confound
this with the one at the corner of Vernon Street. This
theatre was erected in 1760. Little attention was paid
to design in the building. The view from the boxes was
intercepted by large pillars supporting the upper tier
and roof. It was lighted by plain oil lamps, without
glasses, a row of which was placed in front of the stage.
The scenery was dingy,&mdash;chamber-scenes taken from descriptions
of old castles; and altogether the whole presented a
dark and sombre appearance. The stage-box on the east
side in after-years was fitted up for President Washington,
whenever he honored the theatre with his presence, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
which time &#8220;The Poor Soldier&#8221; was played by &#8220;desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much was written and published at this time against
the immoral tendency of the stage; and a cursory glance
at the public papers would lead to a belief that the introduction
of stage-plays was deprecated as being a greater
evil than pestilence and famine. The fathers of the Church
were quoted most appositely on the occasion, and the poor
players were near being confounded with the weight of
authority against them; for, unfortunately, they could not
&#8220;quote Scripture for their purpose.&#8221; Occasionally some
one was bold enough to raise his voice in their defence,
but it was heard as the small note of the oaten reed
amidst the braying of the warlike trumpet. More, however,
is effected by steady perseverance than by violent
measures. The players pursued the &#8220;even tenor of their
way,&#8221; and as the mass of the people did not foresee the
evil consequences which the more enlightened apprehended,
they attracted full audiences, which kept up their spirits
in spite of the papal bulls incessantly issued against
them.</p>

<p>We have here to correct an error of Mr. J. F. Watson
in his celebrated &#8220;Annals of Philadelphia.&#8221; In doing so,
the writer of this would merely remark that this error of
Watson&#8217;s evidently arises from his distaste to the subject
of theatres; for had he exercised a twentieth part of his
usual judgment in tracing past occurrences, incidents, &amp;c.,
this would not have occurred. Page 471, first volume of
Watson&#8217;s Annals, we find this paragraph:&mdash;&#8220;In 1760 a
large building, constructed of wood, situated in South
Street above Fourth Street, was opened,&#8221; &amp;c. &amp;c. &#8220;The
managers were Hallam &amp; Henry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. John Henry, the partner of Hallam in after-years,
arrived in New York from England in 1767, and made
his first appearance at the John Street Theatre, New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
York, December 7 of that year. The company was still
Douglas&#8217;s .</p>

<p>Mr. Wemyss, in his Chronology of the American Stage,
says that the John Street Theatre opened December 7,
1767, under the management of Hallam &amp; Henry, and in
the same book announces his first appearance in America,
on that very evening, as <i>Aimwell</i> in The Beau Stratagem.
Hallam &amp; Henry did not form a partnership until the
21st of November, 1784. Douglas having gone to Jamaica,
where he received a judgeship under the British crown,
he relinquished the sceptre of the American company to
Hallam, his step-son, who took for his partner John Henry.
How our friend Wemyss could fall into so gross an error
is entirely beyond our comprehension. The South Street
Theatre opened under Hallam &amp; Henry&#8217;s management in
1786.</p>

<p>The members of the old South Street company, in 1761,
consisted of Messrs. Douglas, Hallam, Allyn, Morris,
Quelch, Tomlinson, Street, Reed, Tremaine, and Master
A. Hallam, Mesdames Douglas, Morris, Crane, Allyn,
and Miss Hallam.</p>

<p>To the antiquarian the subject of our drama and stage
would afford a wide range for the display of his genius in
that line, as they embrace the very &#8220;<i>M&eacute;moires pour Servir</i>&#8221;
for a volume.</p>

<p>We have referred to these reminiscences of the olden
time simply to contrast the past with the present; for in
tracing up the progress of any one institution connected
with the government, it necessarily follows that every
thing else must have a corresponding progressive interest.
Reminiscences, however, are but retrogressive shadows
that come over us in their gloom, as they conjure up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
spirits of those who have long since passed away from the
earth, as have all those scenes which the &#8220;Old Mortalities&#8221;
of the present take delight in repainting. &#8220;Passing Away&#8221;
is but the result of the onward march of Time:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1753, on the death of the postmaster-general for
America, Benjamin Franklin and Colonel William Hunter,
of Virginia, by a joint commission from the English postmaster-general,
were appointed to succeed him. The two
American deputies were to have &pound;600 per annum between
them, provided they could raise the sum from the net
proceeds of their office. The colonial post-office receipts
had never been sufficient to pay a shilling of revenue into
the English treasury; and to render them productive
enough to yield the compensation mentioned, various
reforms were necessary, and Franklin immediately set
about introducing them. In the summer of 1753 he
started out on a tour of inspection, and visited every post-office
in the colony, except that of Charleston, infusing
new vigor into the service, and putting the whole upon
an improved footing.</p>

<p>After four years&#8217; almost unremitting attention to the
postal service, the new system began to tell, and the results
were that the receipts soon yielded the salary of the postmaster,
and considerably increased the revenue of the
government. As he himself stated, it &#8220;yielded three times
as much clear profit to the crown as the post-office of
Ireland did.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the modern postal system was based in part upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
that of Charles II.&#8217;s time, much of it remains to this day;
but the vast improvements made give to the original
plan what can be better expressed in the language of the
Emperor Augustus: &#8220;I found Rome all brick, and left
it all marble.&#8221; Thus the postal department, then in a
<i>debris</i> state of chaotic confusion, presents at the present
time an institution wherein order and system reign
supreme.</p>

<p>Franklin made every department pay. The carrying of
newspapers was made a source of revenue: previous to
his administration they had been carried free. He charged
each subscriber who received a newspaper by mail nine
pence a year for fifty miles, and eighteen pence a year for
one hundred miles. Post-riders received orders to take
all newspapers offered, instead of only those issued by a
<i>postmaster</i>. Franklin himself being both postmaster and
newspaper publisher, this action on his part was considered
worthy the man and his position. The speed of the post-riders
was accelerated by his energy, and their number
increased to meet the public demand.</p>

<p>In 1753 the delivery of letters by the penny post was
first begun, and at the same time letters were regularly
advertised. Letters from all the neighboring counties
were sent to Philadelphia, and lay there until called for.</p>

<p>Our readers can form some idea of the mode of travelling
between cities, when we state that Franklin improved on
the old system by starting a mail from Philadelphia, to
run three times a week in summer, to New York and
Boston, and once a week in winter. To get an answer
from Boston a Philadelphian had been obliged to wait
six weeks. Franklin reduced the time to three. The
rates of postage were also materially reduced. The rate
across the ocean was fixed at one shilling, and, strange as
it may seem, it has not changed since, although one hundred
years have elapsed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the post-roads then were mere bridle-paths
through forests. &#8220;Even,&#8221; says a writer, &#8220;between Amboy
and Trenton, the very road along which Franklin the
runaway apprentice had wearily trudged in the rain in
1723, had as late as 1775 a stake set up every two miles
to keep the traveller from going astray.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1765 Mrs. Franklin, writing to her husband, then in
England, says, &#8220;The Southern mail has not come in, nor
has the Virginia mail, for more than two months.&#8221; Little
intercourse at that period. The name of Franklin in
connection with science, and his being deputy postmaster-general,
was not only a household word from Boston to
Charleston, but was also extensively known in Europe.
Only two American names were then familiar to the Old
World,&mdash;Jonathan Edwards in the religious world, and
Benjamin Franklin in the circle of science. Jonathan
Edwards was born at Windsor, in the province of Connecticut,
in 1703. He graduated at Yale College, and
afterwards was a tutor in the establishment. He was
ordained in the ministry in 1727. His chief works are a
&#8220;Treatise on the Religious Affections,&#8221; &#8220;An Enquiry into
the Notion of Freedom of Will,&#8221; &#8220;A Treatise on Original
Sin,&#8221; &#8220;Religious Narratives,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1756 an attempt was made, instigated by some political
enemies, to induce the postmaster-general to remove
Franklin from office, as being a &#8220;factious and troublesome
man.&#8221; As the cause assigned was so trifling, the
postmaster-general sent his &#8220;deputy&#8221; a letter of reprimand,
or rather one of gentle reproof. So the matter
ended.</p>

<p>A copy of the &#8220;Gazette&#8221; bearing date 1747 is in the
possession of a gentleman of this city. Published by B.
Franklin, Postmaster, and D. Hall. All post-office notices
and letters remaining in the post-office were published
in the &#8220;Gazette.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>In 1774 Benjamin Franklin was very summarily dismissed
from the office of postmaster. The letter from
the postmaster-general stated simply &#8220;that the king had
found it necessary to dismiss him from the office of
deputy postmaster-general of America.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to give the readers the reasons
for this act, as the history of Franklin in connection with
the events preceding the Revolution will fully explain
them. <i>The colonies were in a state of incipient revolution.</i></p>

<p>The course pursued by the British Government was
such that, under the excitement arising from its acts, the
colonies declared themselves constitutionally exempt from
all obedience to the measures of the British Parliament,
and that the government of the provinces was in fact
dissolved.</p>

<p>Thus, the Congress held in Philadelphia on the 5th of
September, 1774, will ever be remembered and celebrated
in the annals of history as the first page dedicated to
liberty. It was a congress of men who met to decide the
question whether one man had the power and the right
to rule the million, or the million the right to govern
themselves. The success of our Revolution decided the
question; and counter-rebellions and revolutions can
never change that <i>base</i>, upon which is erected Liberty&#8217;s
throne.</p>

<p>Franklin arrived in Philadelphia, from England, on
the evening of May 5, 1775, and the very next day the
Assembly of Pennsylvania, then in session, appointed him
a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, which was
to convene in Philadelphia four days after. The people
of America had everywhere become exasperated beyond
all further forbearance. The blood of their countrymen
had been wantonly shed by British troops, at Lexington
and Concord, in April; and the call to arms was now
ringing through the land.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>The second Congress, held May 10, 1775, was remarkable
for its action at a moment when liberty was as a
&#8220;waif&#8221; in the political world, liable at every breeze to be
lost in the vortex of its revolutions. It set the seal on
British rule in the colonies forever! It was the first
move morally and physically made against tyranny and
usurpation, and was only surpassed by that which inaugurated
the Fourth of July, 1776, as the birthday of
freedom!</p>

<p>One of the acts of its members was to adopt the
armies of New England, and elect General George Washington
commander-in-chief, and also to adopt a platform
which made colonial resistance, to use a modern term, &#8220;a
military necessity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another of their measures was to correct the postal
department, which during Franklin&#8217;s absence had been
somewhat neglected. A committee was appointed, of
which Franklin was made chairman, to consider the best
means of establishing posts for the conveyance of letters
and intelligence throughout the country. Franklin was
at home in this employment, having served a long apprenticeship
and studied its workings both theoretically
and practically. He drew up a plan for the purpose, and
laid it before the committee, who approved of it at once;
and it was eventually the same as that upon which the
post-office of America is now conducted.</p>

<p>The committee recommended that a postmaster-general
be appointed for the <span class="smcap">United States</span>, who should hold
his office at Philadelphia, and be allowed a salary of one
thousand dollars for himself, and three hundred and forty
dollars per annum for a secretary and controller, &#8220;with
power to appoint such and so many deputies as to him
may seem proper and necessary;&#8221; that a line of posts
should be appointed, under the direction of the postmaster-general,
from Falmouth, in New England, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Savannah, in Georgia, &#8220;with as many cross-posts as he
shall think fit; that the allowance of the deputies in
lieu of salary and all contingent expenses shall be
twenty per cent. on the sums they collect and pay into
the general post-office, annually, when the whole is under,
or not exceeding, one thousand dollars, and ten per
cent. for all sums above that amount a year; that the
several departments account quarterly with the general post-office,
and the postmaster-general annually with the Continental
treasurers, when he shall pay into the receipt of
the said treasurers the profits of the post-office, and if the
necessary expenses of this establishment should exceed the
produce of it, the deficiency shall be made good by the
United Colonies, and paid to the postmaster-general by
the Continental treasurers.&#8221;</p>

<p>This plan, and resolutions accompanying it, were submitted
to Congress, who adopted it, and, taking into
consideration the interest Franklin had always taken in
the department, and also his summary dismissal under
the &#8220;British dynasty,&#8221; unanimously elected Benjamin
Franklin, Esq., postmaster-general for one year, and until
another Congress assembled. Eighteen months had passed
since his dismissal, when he now found himself reinstated
in office with higher rank and augmented authority.
Nay, more: he was postmaster-general under a new ruling
power,&mdash;a power that was uprising like the glorious sun
from the mists and the gloom of a long, dreary night of
wrong and oppression. It was now the dawn of a new
era in the history of men and of nations. <i>It was the dawn
of freedom!</i></p>

<p>The people made a law; and as there cannot be rational
freedom where there are arbitrary restraints, they
adopted Cicero&#8217;s maxim, and proclaimed liberty as the
law of the land:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;<i>Libertas est potestas faciendi id quod jure liceat.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>One of the strongest tests by which the progressive
prosperity of a country may be ascertained is that of its
postal department. It forms a chain which links together
all private and public interests; it links state to state,
countries to countries, nations to nations. It is the
alphabet of the world!</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin appointed Richard Bache, his son-in-law,
deputy postmaster. They established mail-riders
to carry the mails, and stationed them at distances of twenty-five
miles, to deliver from one to the other and return to
their starting-places: they travelled night and day, and
were men selected for their honesty and sobriety.</p>

<p>At the same time it was ordered that three advice-boats
should be established, &#8220;one to ply between North Carolina
and such ports as shall be most convenient to the
place where Congress shall be sitting,&#8221; one other between
the State of Georgia and the same port. The boats to
be armed, and to be freighted by individuals for the sake
of diminishing the public expense.</p>

<p>The state of the country was such that it became necessary
to enlist the services of the most prominent men in
its cause, both at home and abroad; and who so popular
then as Benjamin Franklin? A writer speaking of him
and the period says, &#8220;With a fame unequalled in brilliancy
by that of any other man of those times, not only
as a philosopher and sage, but as a profound political
thinker, and an undaunted asserter of the rights and
liberties of his country, Franklin&#8217;s name was now familiarly
known and revered throughout all Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered at, therefore, that he should have
been appointed one of the commissioners to France? The
commissioners first appointed for this purpose, on the
26th of September, 1776, were Franklin, Silas Dean,
and Thomas Jefferson. The last, however, declined, and
Arthur Lee, of Virginia, was put in his place. Mr. Lee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and Mr. Dean were both in Europe, the former having
been employed several years in England as a colonial
agent, and the latter having been sent out in the preceding
March by the committee of secret correspondence,
with a view to diplomatic as well as commercial objects;
and Franklin, after a boisterous voyage in the United
States sloop-of-war <i>Reprisal</i>, Captain Wickes, and after
escaping from the guns of several British cruisers, met
them in Paris in the latter part of December, 1776.
This portion of history is familiar to all.</p>

<p>In the absence of Franklin, Richard Bache attended to
the post-office business, and in all respects carried out his
father-in-law&#8217;s plans.</p>

<p>In March, 1777, Franklin received from Congress a
commission as minister to Spain.</p>

<p>After residing in Europe nearly nine years, acting in
the capacities named, he returned to America, and arrived
in Philadelphia on the 14th of September, 1785. His
return was greeted with every mark of personal regard
and public respect.</p>

<p>We will close this portion of our postal history, and
Franklin&#8217;s connection with it, by the following letter,
which he wrote to Mr. Thomson shortly after his return
home. It is to be regretted that it is a <i>finale</i> which reflects
but little credit on our government at that time,
and gives occasion for our opponents to repeat the old
saying that &#8220;republics are ungrateful.&#8221; Nor is Franklin&#8217;s
case an isolated one.</p>

<p>Franklin, speaking of unrequited services to his friend,
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see by the minutes,&#8221; speaking of Congress, &#8220;that
they have allowed Mr. Lee handsomely for his services in
England before his appointment to France, in which services
I and Mr. Bollan co-operated with him, and have
had no such allowance, and since his return he has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
very properly rewarded with a good place, as well as my
friend Mr. Jay,&mdash;though these are trifling compensations
in comparison with what was granted by the king to Mr.
Gerard on his return to America. But how different is
what happened to me! On my return from England, in
1775, the Congress bestowed on me the office of postmaster-general,
for which I was very thankful. It was,
indeed, an office I had some kind of right to, as having
previously greatly enlarged the revenue of the post by
the regulations I had contrived and established while I
possessed it under the crown. When I was sent to France,
I left it in the hands of my son-in-law, who was to act as
my deputy. But soon after my departure it was taken
from him and given to Mr. Hazzard. When the English
ministry thought fit to deprive me of the office (that of
postmaster), they left me, however, the privilege of receiving
and sending my letters free of postage, which is
the usage when a postmaster is not displaced for misconduct
in the office; but in America I have ever since had
the postage demanded of me, which since my return from
France has amounted to about fifty pounds, much of it
occasioned by my having acted as minister there.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are so many incidents connected with Benjamin
Franklin&mdash;incidents associated alike with our country&#8217;s
history, its literature, art, and science&mdash;that we are not at
all surprised at the many editions and variety of style of
works written expressly to connect his name with them.
We annex a pleasing little sketch of some of the early
scenes of his life, from notes furnished by Thomas J.
Wharton, Esq., to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
in 1830:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The year 1719 deserves particular remembrance in
the annals of Pennsylvania, as that in which the first
newspaper was printed in the State. These potent engines
exercise so vast an influence for good or evil over men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>&#8217;s
minds and actions in the present age, that a particular history
of their rise and progress would be no idle or unprofitable
task, though out of place here. The first number of the
&#8216;American Weekly Mercury,&#8217; as it was called, appeared
on the 22d of December, 1719, on a half-sheet of the
quarto size, and purported to be printed &#8216;by Andrew
Bradford at <i>the</i> Second Street,&#8217; and to be sold by him and
by John Copson in Market Street. The price was ten
shillings per annum; and this was quite as much as it
deserved. Extracts from foreign journals generally about
six months old, and two or three badly-printed advertisements,
formed the substance of the journal. The office
of the editor was a sinecure,&mdash;at least his <i>pen</i> seems to
have been seldom employed, and little information can
be derived from the journal concerning the existing condition
of Philadelphia. Occasionally a bill of mortality
tells us that one adult and one child died during a certain
week, and even that is beyond the usual number; for
some weeks appear to have passed without a single death.
From the following advertisement, which appears in No.
17, something of the customs and state of things at the
period may be gathered:&mdash;&#8216;These are to give notice
that Matthew Cowley, a skinner by trade, is removed
from Chestnut Street to dwell in Walnut Street, <i>near the
Bridge</i>, where all persons may have their buck and doeskins
dressed, &amp;c.&#8217; &#8216;He also can furnish <i>you</i> with bindings,
&amp;c.&#8217; What new ideas of Walnut Street does not
this hint about a <i>bridge</i> give us! and how plenty must
deer have been in those times, when <i>all persons</i> are invited
to have their skins dressed by Matthew Cowley! And then
what a familiar and village-sort of acquaintance with
everybody does not the transition at the end, from the
third to the second person plural, imply! &#8216;He also can
furnish you with bindings, &amp;c.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine years after the appearance of the American Mercury,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the Philadelphia press was delivered of a second
newspaper, to which the modest title was given of &#8216;The
Universal Instructor of all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania
Gazette.&#8217; In his inimitable autobiography Franklin
has immortalized Keimer, the eccentric publisher of
this journal, whose vanity and selfishness, whose wild
notions upon religion and morals, and whose turn for
poetry and gluttony are so happily and graphically delineated.
Franklin, from whom Keimer had stolen the
idea of a second newspaper, attacked it in a series of
papers published in Bradford&#8217;s journal and called The
Busy-Body.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The &#8216;Universal Instructor&#8217; soon fell into
decay, and then into Franklin&#8217;s hands, by whom it was
very skilfully managed, both for his own profit and for
the interest and edification of the public. An editorial
notice in one of Franklin&#8217;s papers proves, in rather a
ludicrous way, how badly Philadelphia was supplied at
the time (1736) with printing-presses. What was called
the <i>outer form</i> was printed reversely or upside down to
the inner form, and the following apology is offered:&mdash;&#8216;The
printer hopes the irregular publication of this paper will
be excused a few times by his town readers, in consideration
of his being at Burlington with the press, laboring
for the public good to make money more plentiful.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not generally known that this venerable journal
survived till within a year or two of the present time,
under the name of &#8216;The Pennsylvania Gazette.&#8217; The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
third newspaper published in Pennsylvania was &#8216;The
Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser,&#8217; the first
number of which appeared on the 2d of December, 1742;
and several other journals shortly afterwards arose, with
various success. In 1760 five newspapers were published
in the State, all weekly,&mdash;three of them printed in the city,
one in Germantown, and one in Lancaster. In 1810 the
number had increased to sixty-six, of which thirteen were
published in Philadelphia; and in 1824 an official return
to the postmaster-general stated the number at one hundred
and ten, of which eighteen were published in Philadelphia,
eleven of them daily: a prodigious increase, which
argues that the appetite for this food has increased in full
proportion with the population. It is perhaps worth
adding that the first <i>daily</i> newspaper that appeared on the
continent of America was published in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are few persons on record to whose individual
genius and exertions a community has owed so much as to
Dr. Franklin. If William Penn was the political founder
of the province, Franklin may perhaps be denominated
the architect of its literature, the gifted author of many
of its best institutions, and the father of some of the finest
features of our character. It is seldom, however, that
Providence has vouchsafed such a length of years to such
an intellect, and still more seldom that such events occur
as those which developed the powers and capacities of
Franklin&#8217;s mind. The name of this illustrious man is
closely connected with the literary history of Pennsylvania;
but his life and actions are too well known to
require that any elaborate notice of them should be given
here. Referring, therefore, to his own invaluable memoirs
for the events of his personal and political history, I shall
content myself with a short sketch of the principal features
of his literary career. The year 1723 was that in which
Franklin first set his foot in Philadelphia. As he landed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
on Market Street wharf, and walked up that street, an
obscure and almost penniless boy, devouring a roll of
bread, and ignorant where he could find a lodging for the
night, little could he or any one who then saw him anticipate
that later advent, when, sixty years afterwards, he
landed upon the same wharf, amid the acclamations of
thousands of spectators, on his return from an embassy in
which he had dictated to his former king the terms of
peace for the confederated republics, of one of which he
was placed at the head, and not merely distinguished as a
politician, but covered with literary honors and distinctions
from every country in Christendom by which genius and
public virtue were held in estimation. And yet the change
was scarcely greater for Franklin than for Philadelphia.
The petty provincial village, with its scattered houses
dotted over the bank of the Delaware, had become a magnificent
metropolis, distinguished for the wisdom and liberality
of its institutions, and as the seat of a general and
republican government, which at the former period could
scarcely have entered into his dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the time of Franklin&#8217;s arrival in Philadelphia there
were two printing-offices in operation. Keimer, the proprietor
of one of them, had but one press and a few worn-out
types, with which, when Franklin visited him, he was
composing an elegy, literally of his own <i>composition</i>, for
it had never gone through the usual process in this manufacture,
of pen and ink, but flowed at once from his
brain to the press. The subject of these typographical
stanzas was <i>Aquila Rose</i>, an apprentice in the office, whose
surname naturally suggested to the mind of Keimer some
touching figures. If we may judge from some specimens
of his poetry which Thomas has preserved in his History
of Printing, the province lost little by Keimer&#8217;s emigration
to Bermuda, which took place shortly afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps, if we except his scientific and political labors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>&mdash;labors
which won him a name while living and honored
when dead,&mdash;there was no other department wherein business
and tact were so united to effect a great national
reform as in that of the post-office.</p>

<p>And yet historians pass over that portion of his life
with a mere dash of the pen, and seem to consider it a
dry episode in his otherwise eventful career. Had they
gone into the history of this connection, the business of
the postal department would have loomed up before them
a splendid subject to descant upon. It would have shown
them how out of chaos came forth, under Franklin&#8217;s control,
a form perfect in shape and gigantic in its proportions.
It would tower a giant above the many lesser subjects
he wrote pages upon, and give to the world a leaf
in our book on political economy which is now&mdash;at least
as far as this department is concerned&mdash;a blank page.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, at the head of the postal department
under the colonial government, was the great pioneer
in the cause of <i>letters</i>: he mapped the length and breadth
of their extent; brought distant places together by the
speed of horses, as he did in after-years by electric power
the lightning from the surcharged clouds to our very
feet.</p>

<p>And when at the head of the department, under the
<i>States united</i> forming a Union that has made us a nation
among nations, to be honored, respected, and <i>feared</i>, he
carried out his plans, based upon a principle that has
governed the operations of the postal department to this
day.</p>

<p>Franklin died April 17, 1790. In his will, dated July
17, 1788, he simply expressed his wish to have his body
buried with as little expense or ceremony as might be.
But in the codicil, dated June 23, 1789, but a few months
before his death, we find this clause:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to be buried by the side of my wife, if it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
be, and that a marble stone, to be made by Chambers, six
feet long, four feet wide, plain, with only a small moulding
round the upper ledge, and this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="inscription" style="border-collapse: collapse;" width="60%" border="0">

<td class="center bb2">178-.</td>
<td class="left bb2 br2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>

<p>to be placed over us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the graveyard belonging to Christ Church in this
city, situated at the southeast corner of Arch and Fifth
Streets, this plain slab, with the above inscription, is still
to be seen.</p>

<p>The man to whose memory it is dedicated, in immediate
expectation of death (as is shown by the fact that the
codicil was made in June, 1789, and the figures 178-are
so arranged by him that unless he died in that very
year they would be useless), had calmly and deliberately
selected the spot where he wished his corpse to repose.
There rest the remains of one whose name, though simply
recorded on a piece of marble, lives in memory while
reason holds its throne in the immortal mind.</p>

<p>There is in the simple gray stone which now covers the
breasts of &#8220;Benjamin Franklin and Deborah his wife&#8221;
more attraction and genuine respectability than could be
found in the loftiest pillar ever reared to gratify mere
ambition.</p>

<p>Richard Bache had acted as postmaster up to 1776,
when he was succeeded by Ebenezer Hazard. Hazard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>&#8217;s
name is better known as an editor than as a postmaster,
as he subsequently compiled the valuable historical collections
bearing his name. He held the office of postmaster
until the inauguration of President Washington&#8217;s
administration. The succession of postmaster-generals
since the adoption of the Federal Constitution will be
given in its proper place.</p>

<b>Reminiscences.</b></h2>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>MAD ANTHONY WAYNE AND JEMMY THE ROVER.</i></h3>

<p>In the year 1776 authority was given to employ extra
post-riders between the armies from the head-quarters to
Philadelphia. These post-riders ran many risks, as refugees
were not rare at that day: hence the danger was materially
increased in consequence. The letters of General
Wayne were interrupted, as were those of others, and the
utmost caution was necessary for the purpose of securing
a safe conveyance. Various plans were adopted, and the
postmaster was active in establishing a postal communication
with the armies. There was another mode, however,
which was even more successful, but equally dangerous
to the parties engaged: this was the spy system. Much
valuable information was conveyed to the commanders of
the armies by it, which could not have reached them
through the regular post. In one of General Wayne&#8217;s
letters, addressed to his family in 1781, he makes allusion
to one &#8220;Jemmy the Rover,&#8221; whom he had employed as a
spy. While our army was encamped at Valley Forge,
Jemmy was repeatedly sent within the British lines, and
always returned with correct and important information.
With him originated the appellation of &#8220;Mad Anthony&#8221;
as applied to the general. &#8220;Jemmy the Rover&#8221; was an
Irishman by birth, and was a regularly-enlisted soldier in
the Pennsylvania line. The real name of Jemmy is not
known. He was subject to, or at least feigned, occasional
fits of craziness, in which state he often proved very noisy
and troublesome, and in one instance was ordered to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
guard-house. Whilst the sergeant with a file of men was
conducting him thither, Jemmy suddenly halted, and asked
the sergeant by whose orders he was arrested. &#8220;By those
of the general,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Then forward!&#8221; said
the Rover. In the course of a few hours he was released.
In the act of taking his departure, he asked the sergeant
whether Anthony (this being the only name he gave
General Wayne) was mad or in fun when he placed him
under arrest. The answer was, &#8220;The general has been
much displeased with your disorderly conduct, and a repetition
of it will be followed not only by confinement, but
by <i>twenty-nine</i> well laid on.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; exclaimed Jemmy,
&#8220;Anthony is mad: farewell to you; clear the coast for the
commodore, Mad Anthony&#8217;s friend!&#8221; He suddenly disappeared
from the camp. In a postscript to a letter
General Wayne wrote to his family, he says, &#8220;Jemmy the
Rover, <i>alias</i> the commodore, has absented himself from
this detachment of the army. Should he in his rambles
pass your way, I hope that you will extend towards him
every hospitality which may be most likely to minister to
his comfort. I am convinced that, whether in his hours
of sanity or insanity, he would cheerfully lay down his
life for either me or any of my family.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is said by some who knew Jemmy that he was a man
of good education and extraordinary shrewdness: in fact,
it was much doubted whether or not Jemmy feigned derangement.</p>

<p>As every thing having any connection with the events of
1776, which led to our independence, must be of interest, it
may not be out of place here to introduce the following remarkable
prophecy, made in the eighth century by Merlin, the
celebrated Welsh astrologer. Its fulfilment in almost every
particular renders it the more interesting, as evidenced in
the American Revolution, to which reference seems to
have been made. Had this prophecy been published subsequent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
to the Revolution, its authenticity might have
been doubted, or at least questioned. But it is copied
from Hawkins&#8217;s work, published in the year 1530.</p>

<p>In connection with the prophecy, we also give the key,
furnished by an old citizen of Philadelphia to the editors
of the &#8220;Columbian Magazine,&#8221; published in this city, in
the March number, 1787:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center padr3">&#8220;<i>SIBYLLINE ORACLE.</i></p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p><i>Verse 1.</i>&mdash;The settlement of America by a civilized
nation is very clearly alluded to in the first line. The
frantic mother is Britain. America still feels the wounds
she has received from her.</p>

<p><i>Verse 2.</i>&mdash;The Cock is France, the Dove is America,
Columbia; their union is the epocha when America shall
cease to love Britain.</p>

<p><i>Verse 3.</i>&mdash;In many parts of Europe there are subterranean
works carried on by persons who never see the light
of day. But perhaps the solution may more particularly
be referred to the siege of York, in Virginia, where the
approaches were carried on by working in the earth. In
the second line there is another equivoque. We are told
by Mr. Addison, in his &#8220;Spectator,&#8221; that a lion will not
hurt a true maid. This, at first view, seems to be contradicted
by the prophecy; but, on examination, the epocha
referred to, the virgin, Columbia (or, perhaps, <i>Virginia</i>,
by which name all North America was called in the days
of Queen Elizabeth), shall wound the <i>lion</i>,&mdash;that is,
<i>Britain</i>,&mdash;which shows the precise time when the oracle
should be accomplished.</p>

<p><i>Verse 4</i> clearly alludes to the successes of the united
forces of America and France against those of Britain.</p>

<p><i>Verse 5.</i>&mdash;For the solution of this oracle, as well as all
the rest, we are indebted to the engraving of the <i>arms</i> of
the <i>United States</i> in the &#8220;Columbian Magazine&#8221; for September,
1786. America is clearly designated by the eagle&#8217;s
nest, as it is the only part of the globe where the <i>bald
eagle</i> (the arms of the United States) is to be found. Thus,
this hitherto inexplicable prophecy may now be easily
understood as meaning that when the <i>cock</i>&mdash;that is, France&mdash;shall
protect America (as she did during the late war),
the stars&mdash;that is, the standard of the American empire&mdash;shall
rise in this western hemisphere.</p>

<p><i>Verse 6.</i>&mdash;It is very remarkable that the first discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
of the amazing properties of inflammable air, by means
of which men have been able to explore a region till then
impervious to them, happened in the same year when
<i>Britain&#8217;s </i> strength was so reduced as to oblige her to
acknowledge the independence of America. The <i>boats</i>
in which the adventurous aeronauts traversed the upper
regions are the <i>ships</i> here referred to.</p>

<p>Thus far the prophecy seems to have been already fully
and literally accomplished: it is to be hoped that the
accomplishment of those which remain is not far remote.</p>

<p><i>Verse 7</i> I understand to mean that when the <i>sea</i>
(<i>Neptune&#8217;s back</i>) is <i>red</i> with the <i>American stripes</i>, the naval
power of Britain shall decline. A proper exertion in the
art of ship-building would soon produce this effect; and
whenever Congress is vested with the power of regulating
the commerce of America, we may hope to see the full
accomplishment of this prediction.</p>

<p><i>Verse 8.</i>&mdash;This oracle clearly alludes to an epocha not
far removed, as we may hope; for when the <i>thirteen</i> United
States shall, under the auspices of the present <i>federal convention</i>,
have strengthened and cemented their union by a
proper revisal of the articles of confederation, so as to be
really but <span class="smcap">ONE NATION</span>, Britain will no longer be able to
maintain that rank and consequence among the nations of
the earth which she had hitherto done.</p>

<p>Since the publication of this explanation, the fulfilment
of the two last has become a part and portion of our
history. That Neptune&#8217;s back is red with the stripes and,
we may add, stars, every child knows; and the sickly lion
already hides his head, not only beneath the folds of our
flag, but plays second fiddle to the cock of France.</p>

<p>The eighth is fully accomplished, and &#8217;76, as well as
seven and six, form a pleasing illustration of the prophecy,
as they do one of the most interesting incidents in our
history. The thirteen States (seven and six) have multiplied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
nearly thrice since the Declaration of Independence,
and are now, as then, but one, and that one a nation.</p>

<p>Walter Scott, speaking of Merlin, or the Savage, as he
was called, says, &#8220;The particular spot in which he is
buried is still shown, and appears, from the following quotation,
taken from a description of Tweeddale, 1715,to
have partaken of his prophetic qualities:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8216;When Tweed and Pausayl meet</div>
<div class="line i1">At Merlin&#8217;s&nbsp; grave,</div>
<div class="line i0">Scotland and England shall one</div>
<div class="line i1">Monarch have.&#8217;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For the same day that our King James the Sixth was
crowned king of England, the river Tweed, by an extraordinary
flood, so far overflowed its banks that it met and
joined with the Pausayl at the said grave, which was
never before observed to fall out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The precise spot pointed out to travellers is situated
near Drumelzier, a village upon the Tweed.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>FOURTH OF JULY, 1776.</i></h3>

<p class="center">&#8220;The first motion in Congress was to declare this country independent.&#8221;
</p>

<p>The first assembling of the Revolutionary Congress took
place in this city on the 5th of September, 1774. Subsequently
the progress of the war continued to ripen the
public mind and feelings for a total separation from
Great Britain. It was not, however, until the 7th of
June, 1776, that any special action was had for that purpose.
On that day Richard Henry Lee, a delegate from
Virginia, made the following motion, which was seconded
by John Adams:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To declare these united colonies free and independent
States; that they are dissolved from all allegiance to the
British crown, and that all political connection between them
and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally
dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
procuring assistance of foreign powers, and that a confederation
be formed to bind the colonies more closely together.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following day the subject was debated, and on
the 1st of July a committee consisting of five delegates&mdash;Messrs.
Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, R. Sherman, and
R. R. Lawrence&mdash;was selected by ballot to draft a
<span class="smcap">Declaration of Independence</span>.</p>

<p>According to parliamentary usage, Mr. Lee would have
been the chairman of this committee; but he was absent in
Virginia on account of the illness of a member of his
family. Mr. Jefferson, however, having the greatest
number of votes, was selected by the other members of
the committee to act as chairman, and the draft prepared
by him was first read in committee. Some verbal alterations
were made by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams, and it
was not thought necessary to read the drafts prepared by
the others. It was stated at the time that the other
members of the committee were so pleased with Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s
draft that they would not submit theirs even for consideration.
Perhaps no higher compliment was ever paid
to the author of <i>our</i> Declaration of Independence than
that which emanated from the gentlemen who composed
this committee.</p>

<p>The Declaration, thus prepared and amended, was finally
adopted in Congress on the 4th, and was read to a meeting
of the citizens of Philadelphia, assembled at the State-House
yard, from the steps of the building.</p>

<p>The house in which Mr. Jefferson wrote the Declaration
is still standing, at the southwest corner of Seventh and
Market Streets. Mr. Jefferson had rooms in it as a lodger
when a member of the Congress of &#8217;76. Two days before
the adoption of the Declaration and its promulgation, Mr.
Adams, in a letter addressed to his wife, makes use of the
following language:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
generations as the grand anniversary festival. It
ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by
solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to
be solemnized with pomp, shows, games, sports, guns, bells,
bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of the continent
to the other, from this time forward and forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure
that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and to
support and defend the States: yet through all the gloom
I can see the rays of light and glory. I can see that the
end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity
will triumph, although you and I may rue it,&mdash;which I
hope we shall not.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the bell sounded forth from the steeple of the
old State-House, the first peal for liberty gave new life to
the citizens: from lip to lip, from street to street, from
city, town, and through the country, away, away, the
words roll like the waves of the ocean, and reverberating
like the roar of the wind as, undulating, it passed through
all space. The city of Philadelphia on the afternoon of
July 4, 1776, presented to view a city convulsed. Joy
united with patriotism, and then the word &#8220;Freedom!&#8221;
became the watchword.</p>

<p>When the news reached New York, the bells were set
ringing, and the excited multitude, surging hither and
thither, at length gathered around the Bowling Green,
and, seizing the leaden equestrian statue of George III.
which stood there, broke it into fragments: this was
afterwards run into bullets and hurled against his
majesty&#8217;s troops.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> When the Declaration arrived in
Boston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the people gathered around old Faneuil Hall to hear
it read, and, as the last sentence fell from the lips of the
reader, a loud shout went up, and soon from every fortified
height and every battery the thunder of cannon re-echoed
the cry.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LIBERTY-TREE.</i></h3>

<p>During the Stamp Act excitement there arose a practice
of signifying public sentiment in a very effectual way,&mdash;though
without any responsible agent, unless the inanimate
Liberty-Tree may be so considered. This tree was
a majestic elm that stood in front of a house opposite the
Boylston market, on the edge of the &#8220;High Street,&#8221; in the
town of Boston. On the 14th of August, 1765, an effigy
representing Andrew Oliver, a gentleman appointed to
distribute the stamps, was found hanging upon this tree,
with a paper before it, on which was written, in large
characters,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i0">And, instead of stamping others, I&#8217;ve hang&#8217;d myself.</div>

<p>On another part of the tree a boot was suspended,&mdash;the
emblem of the Earl of Bute, First Lord of the Treasury,&mdash;from
which the devil, with the Stamp Act in his hand,
was looking out. Chief Justice&mdash;afterwards Governor&mdash;Hutchinson,
directed the sheriff to remove this exhibition;
but his deputies, from a fear of the popular feeling,
declined. In the evening the figures were taken down by
the people and carried in procession through the streets.
After demolishing the stamp-office, in State Street, they
proceeded to Fort Hill, where a bonfire was made of
the pageantry in sight of Mr. Oliver&#8217;s house. It being
intimated to Mr. Oliver that it would conduce to the
quiet of the public if he would go to the tree and openly
resign his commission, he appeared the next day, and declared,
in the presence of a large concourse of people, that
he would not continue in office. It was thenceforward
called the Liberty-Tree, and the following inscription
placed upon it:&mdash;&#8220;This tree was planted in the year 1614,
and pruned by the order of the Sons of Liberty, February
14, 1766.&#8221; On future occasions there was seldom any
excitement on political subjects without some evidence
of it appearing on this tree. Whenever obnoxious offices
were to be resigned or agreements for patriotic purposes
entered into, the parties were notified to appear at the
tree, &#8220;where they always found pens and paper, and
a numerous crowd of witnesses, though the genius of the
tree was invisible. When the British army took possession
of Boston, in 1774, Liberty-Tree fell a victim to
their vengeance, or to that of the persons to whom its
shade had been disagreeable.&#8221; Liberty-trees were consecrated
in Charlestown, Lexington, and Roxbury, Mass.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and also in Charleston, S.C., Newport and Providence,

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>YANKEE DOODLE:&mdash;THE AIR AND WORDS.</i></h3>

<p>There are so many versions of the origin of this popular
and now national air, as well as the words, that we offer
the following to our readers without note or comment.</p>

<p>In Burgh&#8217;s Anecdotes of Music, vol. iii. p. 405, after
speaking of Dr. Arne and John Frederick Lampe, the
author proceeds:&mdash;&#8220;Besides Lampe and Arne, there were
at this time [1731] other candidates for musical fame of
the same description. Among these were Mr. John
Christian Smith, who set two English operas for Lincoln&#8217;s
Inn Fields,&mdash;Teraminta and Ulysses,&mdash;and Dr. Tresh,
author of the oratorio of Judith.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the year 1797, after having become a tolerable
proficient on the German flute, I took it into my head
to learn the bassoon, and for this purpose procured an
instrument and book of instructions from the late Mr.
Joseph Carr, who had then recently opened a music-store
in Baltimore City, being the first regular establishment of
the kind in this country. In this book there was an &#8220;Air
from Ulysses,&#8221; which was the identical air now called
Yankee Doodle, with the exception of a few notes which
time and fancy may have added.</p>

<p>Here is another version:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the simultaneous attacks that were made upon the
French posts in America in 1755, that against Fort Du
Quesne (the present site of Pittsburg) was conducted by
General Braddock, and those against Niagara and Frontenac
by Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts, and General
Johnston, of New York. The following is an extract
from Judge Martin&#8217;s History of North Carolina, giving
an account of those expeditions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The army of the latter (Shirley and Johnston), during
the summer, lay on the eastern bank of the Hudson, a
little south of the city of Albany. In the early part of
June the troops of the Eastern provinces began to pour in,
company after company; and such a motley assemblage
of men never before thronged together on such an occasion,
unless an example may be found in the ragged regiment
of Sir John Falstaff. It would have relaxed the
gravity of an anchorite to have seen the descendants of
the Puritans, marching through the streets of that ancient
city (Albany), take their situations on the left of the
British army,&mdash;some with long coats, and others with no
coats at all, with colors as various as the rainbow,&mdash;some with
their hair cropped like the army of Cromwell, and others
with wigs, the locks of which floated with grace around
their shoulders. Their march, their accoutrements, and
the whole arrangement of the troops, furnished matter of
amusement to the rest of the British army. The music
played the airs of two centuries ago; and the <i>tout ensemble</i>,
upon the whole, exhibited a sight to the wondering strangers,
to which they had been unaccustomed. Among the
club of wits that belonged to the British army there was
a Doctor Shackburg, attached to the staff, who combined
with the science of surgeon the skill and talents of a
musician. To please the new-comers, he composed a
tune, and with much gravity recommended it to the
officers as one of the most celebrated airs of martial music.
The joke took, to the no small amusement of the British.
Brother Jonathan exclaimed it was <i>nation fine</i>, and in a
few days nothing was heard in the provincial camp but
the air of Yankee Doodle. Little did the author in his
composition then suppose that an air made for the purpose
of levity and ridicule should ever be marked for
such high destinies. In twenty years from that time the
national march inspired the heroes of Bunker Hill, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
in less than thirty years Lord Cornwallis and his army
marched into the American lines to the tune of Yankee
Doodle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watson, in his &#8220;Occurrences of the War of Independence,&#8221;
says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This tune, so celebrated as a national air of the Revolution,
has an origin almost unknown to the mass of the
people of the present day. An aged and respectable lady,
born in New England, told me she remembered it well,
long before the Revolution, under another name. It was
then universally called &#8216;Lydia Fisher,&#8217; and was a favorite
New England jig. It was then the practice with it,
as with Yankee Doodle now, to sing it with various impromptu
verses,&mdash;such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8216;Lydia Locket lost her pocket,</div>
<div class="line i1">Lydia Fisher found it;</div>
<div class="line i0">Not a bit of money in it,</div>
<div class="line i1">Only binding round it.&#8217;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;The British, preceding the war, when disposed to
ridicule the simplicity of the Yankee manners and hilarity,
were accustomed to sing airs or songs set to words invented
for the passing occasion, having for their object to
satirize and sneer at the New Englanders. This, as I believe,
they called Yankee Doodle, by way of reproach,
and as a slur upon their favorite &#8216;Lydia Fisher.&#8217; It is
remembered that the English officers then among us,
acting under civil and military appointments, often felt
lordly over us as colonists, and by countenancing such
slurs they sometimes expressed their superciliousness.
When the battles of Concord and Lexington began the
war, the English, when advancing in triumph, played
along the road, &#8216;God save the King;&#8217; but when the Americans
had made the retreat so disastrous to the invaders,
these then struck up the scouted <i>Yankee Doodle</i>,&mdash;as if to say,
&#8216;See what we simple Jonathans can do!&#8217; From that time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the term of intended derision was assumed throughout
all the American colonies, as the national air of the Sons
of Liberty; even as the Methodists&mdash;once reproachfully
so called&mdash;assumed it as their acceptable appellation.
Even the name of &#8216;Sons of Liberty,&#8217; which was so popular
at the outset, was a name adopted from the appellation given
us in Parliament by Colonel Barr&eacute; in his speech! Judge
Martin, in his History of North Carolina, has lately
given another reason for the origin of &#8216;Yankee Doodle,&#8217;
saying it was first formed at Albany, in 1755, by a British
officer, then there, indulging his pleasantry on the homely
array of the motley Americans then assembling to join
the expedition of General Johnston and Governor Shirley.
To ascertain the truth in the premises, both his and my
accounts were published in the gazettes, to elicit, if possible,
further information, and the additional facts ascertained
seem to corroborate the foregoing idea. The tune
and quaint words, says a writer in the &#8216;Columbian Gazette,&#8217;
at Washington, were known as early as the time of
Cromwell, and were so applied to him then, in a song
called &#8216;Nankee Doodle,&#8217; as ascertained from the collection
he had seen of a gentleman at Cheltenham, in England,
called &#8216;Musical Antiquities of England,&#8217; to wit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;&#8216;Nankee Doodle came to town</div>
<div class="line i1">Upon a little pony,</div>
<div class="line i0">With a feather in his hat,</div>
<div class="line i1">Upon a macaroni,&#8217; &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;The term feather, &amp;c. alluded to Cromwell&#8217;s going
into Oxford on a small horse, with his single plume fastened
in a sort of knot called a &#8216;macaroni.&#8217; The idea that
such an early origin may have existed seems strengthened
by the fact communicated by an aged gentleman of Massachusetts,
who well remembered that, about the time the
strife was engendering at Boston, they sometimes conveyed
muskets to the country concealed in their loads of manure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
&amp;c. Then came abroad verses, as if set forth from their
military masters, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;&#8216;Yankee Doodle came to town</div>
<div class="line i1">For to buy a firelock:</div>
<div class="line i0">We will tar and feather him,</div>
<div class="line i1">And so we will John Hancock.&#8217;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;The similarity of the first lines of the above two examples,
and the term &#8216;feather&#8217; in the third line, seem to
mark in the latter some knowledge of the former precedent.
As, however, other writers have confirmed their early
knowledge of &#8216;Lydia Locket,&#8217; such as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;&#8216;Lydy Locket lost her pocket</div>
<div class="line i1">In a rainy shower,&#8217; &amp;c.,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>we seem led to the choice of reconciling them severally
with each other. We conclude, therefore, that the Cavaliers,
when they originally composed &#8216;Nankee Doodle,&#8217;
may have set it to the jig-tune of &#8216;Lydia Fisher,&#8217; to make
it the more offensive to the Puritans. In this view it was
even possible for the British officer at Albany, in 1755, as
a man skilled in music, to have before heard of the old
&#8216;Nankee Doodle,&#8217; and to have renewed it on that occasion.
That the air was uniformly deemed a good retort on
British royalists, we must be confirmed in from the fact
that it was played by us at the battle of Lexington when
repelling the foe, again at the surrender of Burgoyne,
and finally at Yorktown surrender, when Lafayette, who
ordered the tune, meant it as a retort on an intended
affront.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is the first verse in the original <i>American</i>
Yankee Doodle song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">&#8220;Yankee Doodle, keep it up,</div>
<div class="line i1">Do it neat and handy:</div>
<div class="line i0">The boy to flog the British troops</div>
<div class="line i1">Is Yankee Doodle Dandy.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>HAIL COLUMBIA.</i></h3>

<p>The following is Judge Hopkinson&#8217;s own account of the
origin of &#8220;Hail Columbia:&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This song was written in the summer of 1798, when
a war with France was thought to be inevitable, Congress
being then in session in Philadelphia, deliberating upon
that important subject, and acts of hostility having actually
occurred. About that time a young man by the
name of Fox, attached to the Chestnut Street Theatre, was
getting up some attraction for his benefit. I had known
him when at school. On this acquaintance he called on
me on Saturday afternoon,&mdash;his benefit being announced
for the following Monday. He said there were no boxes
taken, and his prospect was that he should suffer a loss
instead of receiving a benefit from his performance, but
that if he could get a patriotic song adapted to the tune
of the &#8216;President&#8217;s March&#8217; (then the popular air) he did
not doubt of a full house; that the poets of the theatrical
corps had been trying to accomplish it, but were satisfied
that no words could be composed to suit the music of the
march. I told him I would try for him. He came the
next afternoon, and the song, such as it is, was ready for
him. It was announced on Monday morning, and the
theatre was crowded to excess, and so continued, night
after night, for the rest of the season,&mdash;the song being
encored and repeated many times each night, the audience
joining in the chorus. It was also sung at night in the
streets by large assemblies of citizens, including members
of Congress. The enthusiasm was general, and the song
was heard, I may say, in every part of the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>The President&#8217;s March was composed by Professor
Pfyle, and was played at Trenton Bridge when Washington
passed over on his way to New York to his inauguration.
An old writer, speaking upon this subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
says, &#8220;I have also reason to believe that the Washington&#8217;s
March generally known by that title&mdash;I mean the
one in the key of G major&mdash;was composed by the Hon.
Francis Hopkinson, Senior, having seen it in a manuscript
book of his, in his own handwriting, among other of his
known compositions.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.</i></h3>

<p>Was written by Francis S. Key, while on board one
of the vessels composing the British fleet. He was an
agent for the exchange of prisoners, and witnessed in the
distance the bombardment of Fort McHenry. The tune
was originally set to the song &#8220;To Anacreon in Heaven,&#8221;
by Dr. Arnold.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE PRESENT AMERICAN FLAG.</i></h3>

<p>The first flag adopted by the colonial army before Boston
was a red flag, with the mottoes, &#8220;An appeal to Heaven,&#8221;
and &#8220;Qui transtulit sustinet,&#8221; which was construed by the
colonists thus:&mdash;&#8220;God, who transplanted us hither, will
sustain us.&#8221; About this time also the floating batteries,
which were the germ of the navy subsequently organized,
bore a flag with the motto, &#8220;Appeal to Heaven.&#8221; These
flags were adopted before the union of the colonies was
effected. After that union, and upon the organization of
the army and fleet, these flags were supplanted by one
calculated to show to the world the union of the North
American colonies among themselves and as an integral
part of the British empire, and as such demanding the
rights and liberties of British subjects. And for this purpose
a flag combining the crosses of St. George and St.
Andrew united (the distinctive emblem of Great Britain),
with a field composed of thirteen stripes alternate red and
white, the combination of the flags previously used in the
camps and on the cruises, and the floating batteries of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
colonists, was adopted, and called the <i>Great Union flag</i>.
The union implied both the union of the colonies represented
in the striped field, which was dependent upon it,
and the nationality of those colonies. The thirteen stripes
alternate red and white, constituting the field of the flag,
represented the body of that union, the numbers that composed
it, as well as the union of the flags which had preceded
this Great Union flag. The colors of these stripes,
alternate red and white, indicated on the part of the
colonies thus represented as united the defiance to oppression,
symbolized by the red color of the flag of the
army and the red field of the Continental cruisers, with
the purity implied by the white flag of the floating batteries,
of which the motto was, &#8220;Appeal to Heaven.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> These
flags of the colonies and this Great Union flag gave place
in turn to the flag of the United States, which is thus
described in the following resolution of Congress, passed
June 14, 1777:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Resolved</i>, That the flag of the thirteen United States
be thirteen stripes alternate red and white; that the union
be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new
constellation.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the above it appears that the only alteration made
from the Great Union flag was the substitution of a union
of stars representing &#8220;a new constellation,&#8221; in place of the
old union of the British crosses; and the question is, what
is the meaning of the &#8220;new constellation,&#8221; and is there
any constellation which represents union? The answer is,
that the constellation Lyra is of this character; for, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to classical authority, the Lyra was the symbol of
harmony and unity among men. The constellation Lyra
is a time-honored emblem of union, and because it was so
it gave to our forefathers the idea of the stars now on our
flag, while the stripes have originated as we have mentioned.
May the Stars and the Stripes ever &#8220;wave over
the land of the free and the home of the brave,&#8221; and may
the United States ever be among the nations of the earth
a constellation like Lyra, which is said to &#8220;whirl in harmony
and unity along the immense orb of the revolving
world, and to lead all the other stars.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>CONGRESS.</i></h3>

<p>Previous to the Revolution, and during the war, the
seat of government, or points of meeting of Congress,
were at such places as convenience suggested or the vicissitudes
of war allowed. The first Congress under the
present Constitution met in New York, on the 4th of
March, 1789. George Washington was inaugurated President
before this body, John Adams Vice-President.
F.A. Muhlenberg, of Pennsylvania, was the Speaker of
the House.</p>

<p>The following are the places at which the Continental
Congress met from 1774 to the adoption of the Constitution,
in 1789:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
At Philadelphia, 1774, September 5.<br />
At Baltimore, 1776, December 20.<br />
At Philadelphia, 1777, March 4.<br />
At Lancaster, 1777, September 27.<br />
At York, Pennsylvania, 1777, September 30.<br />
At Philadelphia, 1778, July 2.<br />
At Princeton, 1783, June 30.<br />
At Annapolis, 1783, November 26.<br />

</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>From which time New York continued to be the place
of meeting until the adoption of the Constitution. From
1781 to 1788, Congress met annually (on the first Monday
in November), pursuant to the Articles of Confederation
adopted June 9, 1778.</p>

<p>The first Congress under the Constitution met in New
York on the 4th of March, 1789. The second session of
the same Congress met at New York in January, 1790,
at which session the <i>permanent</i> seat of government was
fixed in the District of Columbia, and the <i>temporary</i> seat
moved from New York to Philadelphia. The third session
of the First Congress was held at Philadelphia, December,
1790, where it continued until December, 1800,
when Congress met for the first time in Washington.</p>

<b>Postmasters.</b></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> brought the postal history of the colonies up
to the time Richard Bache succeeded Benjamin Franklin
(November, 1776), and whose dismissal gave the latter
some grounds of complaint, if not censure, against the
appointment of Ebenezer Hazard, who had the office under
President Washington, we will carry out the object of
these tables, by continuing the list of postmaster-generals
from that period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Osgood.</span>&mdash;This gentleman was born at Andover,
Massachusetts, February 14, 1748; graduated at
Harvard College in 1770; a member of the Massachusetts
Legislature, and also of the board of war, and subsequently
an aid to General Ward; in 1779, a member of
the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention; in 1781,
appointed a member of Congress; in 1785, first commissioner
of the treasury; and September 26, 1789, postmaster-general.
He was afterwards naval officer of the
port of New York, and died in that city, August 12, 1813.</p>

<p>Early in the first session of the Second Congress two
important subjects of a national character received the
attention of the representatives of the people: one was
establishing a national mint, and the other the organization
of the postal system.</p>

<p>The establishing of a mint, however, was delayed, and
no special action was taken in that direction until 1790,
when Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State, urged the
matter upon the attention of Congress. In 1792, April<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
2, laws were enacted for the establishment of a mint. It
did not, however, go into full operation until 1795.</p>

<p>The first mint was located in Philadelphia, and remained
the sole issuer of coin in the United States until 1835,
when a branch was established in each of the States of
Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana,&mdash;in Charlotte,
Dahlonega, and New Orleans. These three branches went
into operation in the years 1837-38.</p>

<p>A bill for the organization of a post-office system was
passed in 1792, simultaneously with that for establishing
the mint.</p>

<p>Very soon after the commencement of the first session
of Congress a letter was received from Ebenezer Hazard
(July 17, 1789), then postmaster-general under the old
Confederation, suggesting the importance of some new
regulations for that department. A bill for the temporary
establishing of a post-office was passed soon afterwards.
The subject was brought up from time to time, until the
present system was organized in 1792. The postmaster-general
was not made a Cabinet-officer until the first year
(1829) of President Jackson&#8217;s administration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timothy Pickering.</span>&mdash;Born at Salem, Massachusetts,
July 17, 1746; graduated in 1763; was colonel of a regiment
of militia at the age of nineteen, and marched for
the seat of war at the first news of the battle of Lexington;
in 1775, was appointed judge of two local courts; in
the fall of 1776, marched to New Jersey with his regiment;
in 1777, appointed adjutant-general, and subsequently a
member of the board of war with Gates and Mifflin; in
1780 he succeeded Greene as quartermaster-general; in
1790 he was employed in negotiations with the Indians;
August 12, 1791, he was appointed postmaster-general;
in 1794, Secretary of War, and in 1795, Secretary of
State; from 1803 to 1811 he was senator, and from 1814<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
to 1817 representative in Congress; died at Salem, June
29, 1829.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Habersham.</span>&mdash;Born in 1750; a lieutenant-colonel
during the Revolutionary War, and in 1785 a
member of Congress; appointed postmaster-general, February
25, 1795; he was afterwards president of the United
States Branch Bank in Savannah, Georgia; died at that
place, November, 1815.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gideon Granger.</span>&mdash;Born at Suffield, Connecticut,
July 19, 1767; graduated at Yale College in 1787, and
the following year admitted to the bar; in 1793, elected
to the Connecticut Legislature; November 28, 1801, appointed
postmaster-general; retired in 1814, and removed
to Canandaigua, New York; April, 1819, elected a member
of the Senate of that State, but resigned in 1821 on
account of ill health. During his service in that body he
donated one thousand acres of land to aid the construction
of the Erie Canal. Died at Canandaigua, December 31,
1822.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Return Jonathan Meigs.</span>&mdash;Born at Middletown,
Connecticut, in 1765; graduated at Yale College in 1785,
and subsequently admitted to the bar; in 1788, emigrated
to Marietta, Ohio, then the Northwestern Territory; in
1790, during the Indian wars, he was sent by Governor
St. Clair on a perilous mission through the wilderness to
the British commandant at Detroit; in the winter of
1802-03 he was elected by the legislature the first chief
justice of the Supreme Court of the new State; in October,
1804, he was appointed colonel commanding the
United States forces in the upper district of the Territory
of Louisiana, and resigned his judgeship; in the following
year he was appointed one of the United States judges for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Louisiana; April 2, 1807, he was transferred to the Territory
of Michigan; in October following he resigned his
judgeship, and was elected Governor of the State of Ohio,
but his election was successfully contested on the ground
of non-residence. He was chosen at the same session as
one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the State, and
at the next session as United States Senator for a vacancy
of one year, and also for a full term. In 1810 he was
again elected Governor of Ohio, and on the 8th of December
resigned his seat in the Senate; in 1812 he was re-elected
Governor; on the 17th of March, 1814, he was
appointed postmaster-general, which he resigned in June,
1823. Died at Marietta, March 29, 1825.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John McLean.</span>&mdash;Born in Morris county, New Jersey,
March 11, 1785. His father subsequently removed to
Ohio, of which State the son continued a resident. He
labored on the farm until sixteen years of age, when he
applied himself to study, and two years afterwards removed
to Cincinnati, and supported himself by copying in
the county clerk&#8217;s office while he studied law. In 1807
he was admitted to the bar; in 1812 he was elected to Congress,
and re-elected in 1814; in 1816 he was unanimously
elected by the legislature a judge of the Supreme Court of
that State; in 1822 he was appointed by President Monroe
commissioner of the General Land-Office, and on the
26th of June, 1823, postmaster-general; in 1829 he was
appointed as one of the justices of the Supreme Court of
the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William T. Barry.</span>&mdash;Born in Fairfax county, Virginia,
March 18, 1780; graduated at the College of William
and Mary. He was admitted to the bar, and in
early life emigrated to Kentucky. In 1828 he was a candidate
for Governor of that State, and defeated by a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
majority after one of the most memorable contests in its
annals; appointed postmaster-general March 9, 1829; in
1835, appointed minister plenipotentiary to Spain, and
died at Liverpool, England, on his way to Madrid.</p>

<p>Mr. Barry was the first postmaster-general who had the
honor of being one of the Cabinet. Whether such a
movement has benefited the postal department or not can
only be ascertained by a reference to its records. As these
present more the appearance of political names, figures,
changes, removals, and a confusion of all the elements
which make up a party, it is doubtful if the public mind
is prepared to view the postal department in any other
light than that of one of the revolving political luminaries
of the country. A reference, however, to some statistics
furnished in this work, and an occasional reference to its
not being a self-sustaining institution, may probably throw
some light upon the subject.</p>

<p>We have avoided, through motives of nationality rather
than of choice, any direct allusion to frauds in the postal
department. &#8220;When Judge McLean left the department
it was,&#8221; said his friends, &#8220;in a thriving condition.&#8221; Such
was not the case. From &#8220;The Aurora,&#8221; edited by the late
William Duane, bearing date January 10, 1835, we take
the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a hopeless task to seek the <i>qualities</i>, <i>actions</i>,
<i>evidence of fitness</i>, or <i>principles</i> of Mr. McLean. We
know he was a member of Congress: can any one <i>discover</i>
any thing which he did there? He was appointed postmaster-general
to cover the <i>retreat</i> of R. J. Meigs, who
should have been removed three years before.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he do in the general post-office? Why,
the men who had practised the most enormous abuses,
which had been proved by <i>blanching evidence</i> before Congress,
he retained in the prosecution of their <i>former business</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reproach is no doubt to be shared with Congress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
which, on the occasion of the investigation of the sale of
post-office drafts, suffered the inquiry to be stifled after
attempts had been made, without success, on some poor
men to suppress the truth, and who were discharged
for their fidelity, whilst others were retained whose
memories, like the memorable Italian delator, was <i>non
mi ricordo</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. McLean entered the general post-office when it
was whelmed in abuses and in debt. Accounts in that
office had not been brought up, or cash accounts balanced,
for several years; and, in fact, no true <i>account</i> of the
affairs of the post-office department at that period had
ever appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. McLean was a mere walking-stick for the <i>directors</i>
of his predecessor. He made some efforts to bring up
the business, and some laws were passed to oblige accountability;
but he left the general post-office as he found it,
deep in debt,&mdash;saddling his successor with the burden, and
leaving the system in such disorder as to render it necessary
for Mr. Barry to organize the department wholly
anew, were it only to extricate it from the hands of those
men who had thrown it all into confusion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Mr. Barry, in his address to the people, speaking of the
department as it came from the hands of Mr. McLean to
him, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The late postmaster-general, in his report dated November
17, 1828, shows that, instead of saving $500,000,
the expenses of his department from the 1st of July, 1827,
to the 1st of July, 1828, were upwards of $25,000 more
than all its revenues for the same period, and that he had
entered into contracts to take effect from the 1st of January,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
1829, which involved the department in an expense,
for the period of only six months from the 1st of January
to the 1st of July, 1829, of $40,778.55 more than all its
revenue for the same time; and that the expenses of the
department for the year commencing the 1st of July, 1828,
were $74,714.15 more than its revenues, and that the
excess of expenditure, together with the losses sustained,
had diminished the finances of the department within one
year to the amount of $101,266.03. In this state of things
I had no agency. It was produced before I came into
office.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amos Kendall.</span>&mdash;Born at Dunstable, Massachusetts,
August 16, 1789; graduated at Dartmouth College in
1811; about the year 1812, removed to Kentucky, and in
1815 was appointed postmaster at Georgetown in that
State; in 1816 he assumed the editorial charge of the
&#8220;Argus,&#8221; published at Frankfort, in the same State, which
he continued until 1829, being most of the time State
printer; in 1829 he was appointed fourth auditor of the
United States Treasury; and May 1, 1835, postmaster-general.
He resigned the latter office in 1840, and has,
since the introduction of the electric telegraph, been mainly
employed in connection with enterprises for its operation.
He is yet living.</p>

<p class="center f8">A GLANCE OVER HIS POSTAL OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The years 1834, &#8217;35, and &#8217;36 were remarkable for an
almost epidemic species of madness on the subject of
slavery, or, rather, upon the question of the immediate
emancipation of the slaves throughout the South. That
this was carried to extremes by both parties there can be
no doubt, and that very extremity became the chief cause
of the rebellion of the South. The question has been settled
by the North that although the South had all she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
claim consistently under an <i>uncertain clause</i> of the Constitution,
she had no right to make slavery a fiendish
monster, that was to ride iron-shod over all the Free States
in the Union, and silence the voice of Christianity in its
peaceful attempts to lessen its evils. As a relic of the long
past, one of the dark pages from Saxon history, the institution
of slavery, as sustained in the South, was a deep,
damning, dark spot on a land that boasted of principles
based on three cardinal precepts, &#8220;virtue, liberty, and
independence,&#8221;&mdash;a misnomer in its Constitution and laws.</p>

<p>While the fanatical portion of the Northern abolitionists
were striving to impress upon the South the enormity of
their crime in sustaining slavery, the South was equally
virulent in its condemnation of their mode of doing so.
Meetings were held all over the country, speeches made,
and passion swayed the judgment to the total extinction
of common sense. The South accused the North of encouraging
amalgamation; the North indignantly denied it,
and with much logic proved that it was a <i>Southern virtue
altogether</i>.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the rebellion: here were the
seeds grown, watered, and nurtured by hatred, envy, and
malice. The South had planted its poisonous root on a
free soil, and it came in contact with its more wholesome
brother: the one began to pale before the venom of the
other, blasting it like &#8220;a mildew&#8217;d ear.&#8221; It is not our
purpose to give a history of these eventful years, nor the
consequence attending the operations of the Northern
opposition party to slavery against Southern arrogance and
presumptuous domination. The question, however, had
to be decided at one time or another; and in 1860 it was
answered by the thunder sound of cannon and flashes from
millions of rifles.</p>

<p>The South became very indignant against the post-office
department, which it accused of an abuse of power, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
<i>permitting</i> what they called &#8220;incendiary publications&#8221; to
pass through the office to individuals in the South. The
Federal Government was called upon to correct this
&#8220;prostitution of its laws,&#8221; which was calculated to affect
its (the South&#8217;s) peculiar &#8220;domestic institution,&#8221; and if
persisted in would be the <span class="smcap">certain destruction of the
Union</span>.</p>

<p>In answer to repeated complaints made to Amos Kendall,
Esq., the then postmaster-general, both from Southern
men and Northern advocates of slavery, he stated distinctly
that he had no legal authority to exclude newspapers from
the mail, nor prohibit their carriage or delivery on account
of their character and tendency, real or supposed. Indeed,
this would be assuming a power over the liberty of the
press which might be perverted and abused to an extent
highly injurious to our republican system of government.</p>

<p>In 1835, Amos Kendall received a letter from the postmaster
at Charleston, stating that he had detained in the
office certain inflammatory newspapers, circulars, pamphlets,
&amp;c., the distribution of which he thought was calculated
to do much harm in the State; in fact, a meeting
was called in that city of its citizens upon the subject of
these &#8220;incendiary documents,&#8221; when it was publicly stated
that &#8220;<i>arrangements had been made with the postmaster, by
which no seditious pamphlets shall be issued or forwarded
from the post-office in this city</i>&#8221;! The committee consisted
of the following-named gentlemen, who had waited upon
the postmaster, and hence his letter to the postmaster-general:&mdash;General
Hayne, John Robinson, Charles Edmonston,
H. A. Desaussure, James Robertson, James Lynah,
Edward R. Laurens. The following is an extract from Mr.
Kendall&#8217;s letter to the postmaster at Charleston: similar
replies to other postmasters from the Southern States were
also forwarded, as it appeared to have been a preconcerted
Southern action. Of this there can be no doubt; for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Charleston letter bore date July 29, 1835, the Richmond
August 8, New Orleans July 15, and Georgia July 10.
Mr. Kendall says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not prepared to direct you to forward or
deliver the papers of which you speak. The post-office
department was created to serve the people of each and
all of the <i>United States</i>, and not to be used as the instrument
of their <i>destruction</i>. None of the papers detained
have been forwarded to me, and I cannot judge for myself
of their character and tendency; but you inform me that
they are in character &#8216;the most inflammable and incendiary,
and insurrectionary in the highest degree.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no act or direction of mine, official or private,
could I be induced to aid knowingly in giving circulation
to papers of this description, directly or indirectly. We
owe an obligation to the laws, but a higher one to the
communities in which we live; and if the <i>former</i> be perverted
to destroy the <i>latter</i>, it is patriotism to disregard
them. Entertaining these views, I cannot sanction, and
will not condemn, the step you have taken. Your justification
must be looked for in the character of the papers
detained, and the circumstances by which you are surrounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The surroundings&#8221; in and near all Southern post-offices
are those which the institution of slavery inaugurates.
Letters from certain Eastern States were subject to
an espionage somewhat similar to that by which a detective
policeman tracks an unsuspecting culprit from haunt to
haunt, acquiring a perfect knowledge of his habits and
the character of his associates. Letters were opened by a
sort of steaming process, read and their contents noted,
carefully sealed again, and delivered to the person to whom
they were directed. If the contents of the letter came
under the denunciatory head, the individual to whom it
was addressed received intimation from the Order of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
&#8220;The Regulators,&#8221; a society formed for the purpose of finding
out abolitionists, to leave the city in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The writer of this resided in the city of New Orleans
at that period, and he knew of the existence of one established
as far back as 1829: it was called the &#8220;Regulators.&#8221;
It was not only formidable in numbers, but
equally so in a political point of view. This order has
since been merged in that of the &#8220;Golden Circle.&#8221; One
of the obligations of the &#8220;Regulators&#8221; was, and is in the
new &#8220;junto,&#8221; to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do promise that I will use my best exertions to find
out any and every one who in any way favors abolitionism,
and who attempts to instruct or enlighten a slave, either
by teaching him his letters, or by giving him religious
instruction,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under this oath men were driven from the South, and
in some instances <i>tarred and feathered</i>! In 1834 the
writer knew an old gentleman from Boston, who, ignorant
of the <i>exclusive</i> slave-laws of the State, was compelled to
quit New Orleans for simply talking to an old black man
about religion and teaching him his letters, so that he
might read the word of God: this, too, in a Christian
land,&mdash;a land of freedom!<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>It may be observed, however, in extenuation even for
such seeming high-handed measures, that as slavery was
an acknowledged institution rearing itself up on the Constitution,
and that some 4,000,000 of human creatures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
were chained to it, it was absolutely necessary to keep
them in ignorance of any sympathy existing for their
degraded state either in the North or the South, lest such
sympathy should excite them to resistance. Hence every
thing that was calculated to throw light on their benighted
pathway, and strengthen any lingering preconceived idea
that they were men and not beasts of burden, was kept
studiously away from them. As long as this country
sanctioned the existence of slavery, just so long was she
justified in protecting those States sustaining it from any
outbreak on the part of its victims. It was an evil that
came in under the Constitution, and it was an evil it was
bound to sustain. The anti-slavery party North carried
their views far beyond common sense and simple reason;
and this led to Southern opposition. But the more enlightened
people viewed both parties as acting wrong, and in
opposing the first they as strongly repudiated the acts of
the latter. And what has been the consequence? The
South, alone in its crime, alone in its inhuman traffic, alone
in its crushing power to make men beasts of burden,&mdash;even
lower in the animal scale than the animal itself,&mdash;like
Lucifer, rebelled against its country and its God.
Thus, slaveholders became barbarians by the very act of
attempting to rivet the chains of bondage on man and his
country. That rebellion recreated in our midst a new
order, or rather carried out the very spirit of the Declaration
of Independence, declaring that these united colonies
are, and of right ought to be, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Free and Independent
States</span>.&#8221; There can be no such thing as freedom, if its
meaning be linked to the chains of slavery. There is no
true freedom for an American to boast of, if one portion
of the land sustains slavery and laughs at the sound of the
lash as it lacerates the back of a bondsman in the nineteenth
century. Age of Christianity! age of refinement! age of
letters! What a misnomer!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>This feeling, which had a tendency to divide the South
from the North, was gradually assuming a dangerous
aspect. It was a feeling antagonistical to that which prevailed
in the North. The one was allied to the age of
barbarism, the other to the highest order of civilization.
The worst passions of bad men were working the evil;
they engendered hatred and malice; and the rising popularity
of the North for its intelligence, its institutions, its
educational system, its arts, its sciences, and, in fact, all
that a high state of intellectual knowledge produces,
added fuel to the hellish fire that was burning in the
Southern breast.</p>

<p>They could boast of only one institution, and that was
slavery. This institution sent forth</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i8">&#8220;the piercing cry</div>
<div class="line i0">Which shook the waves and rent the sky:</div>
<div class="line i0">E&#8217;en now, e&#8217;en now, on yonder western shores</div>
<div class="line i0">Weeps pale Despair, and writhing Anguish roars;</div>
<div class="line i0">E&#8217;en now on Afric&#8217;s groves, with hideous yell</div>
<div class="line i0">Fierce Slavery stalks, and slips the dogs of hell;</div>
<div class="line i0">From vale to vale the gathering cries rebound,</div>
<div class="line i0">And sable nations tremble at the sound!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The South actually could boast of but this one institution:
for all others, either of commerce, agriculture, education,
arts or sciences, they were indebted to the North. And
yet they rebelled!</p>

<p>The moment men, as well as nations, feel their own
insignificance and witness the rising greatness of others,
that moment they begin to plot mischief. Treason is the
offspring of disappointment and a desire for power. Defeated
ambition not unfrequently steps in, and out of such
elements rebellions are made. Lucifer, therefore, may be
quoted as the personification of the treason of Jeff Davis.</p>

<p>The South also made the discovery that slave labor,
devoted only to one object, was demoralizing the soil, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
it had already demoralized society. Northern men and
Northern manners did not suit their ideas of refinement,
and thus the social relations became unpleasant.</p>

<p>Every foot of ground neglected or simply used for one
especial purpose was gradually wearing out. The census
of 1850 furnishes the following facts connected with the
decadency of the Southern soil.</p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty-five thousand natives of Virginia
emigrated from the State of Virginia and found
homes elsewhere. South Carolina sent forth 163,000.
North Carolina lost 261,575,&mdash;equal to thirty-one per cent.
As regards Maryland, the extreme poverty of her soil can
be directly traced to man&#8217;s neglect of what kind Nature
sent him, that by the &#8220;sweat of his brow&#8221; he should cultivate
and enjoy.</p>

<p>If we were to trace the cause of this, it would be found
to have originated in the sterility of the soil, the absence
of free labor and agricultural knowledge. Southern men
are not favorably disposed towards Northern improvements
in any department, no matter whether it be trade, commerce,
or agriculture: hence they have no such farms
South as they have North, even in portions of their
country where the soil is equally susceptible of improvement.</p>

<p>The South stated distinctly, speaking through her secret
councils, using their own language, &#8220;<i>that it could only
hope for the real enjoyment of its rights in a</i> <span class="smcap">Southern
Confederacy</span>&#8221;!</p>

<p>Mr. Kendall&#8217;s letter to the postmaster was applauded
by the Southern press, and most severely censured by that
of the North. One editor said, &#8220;There was but one course
for the postmaster-general to pursue in relation to the distribution
of the documents at Charleston, and that is, to
have directed his subordinate officer to follow the statutes
as laid down, and leave the result to the law. Instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
this, he tells him that it is <i>patriotism sometimes to disregard
the law</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>It is said the law is defective: it may have been in 1835;
but the South, by its own vile act, has made that law so
clear that there is not the least doubt but every Southern
postmaster hereafter, whatever his political opinions may
be, will be fully able to understand it.</p>

<p>Perhaps no man exerted himself more to make the
postal department honored and respected than did Amos
Kendall. He was, consequently, making rules and regulations
organizing the several departments, and watching
each and every operation with a shrewd and business eye
to its interest.</p>

<p>In 1835, under the heading of the &#8220;Organization of the
Post-Office Department,&#8221; he published fifty-six rules and
regulations, concluding with the following remarks, <i>apart
from a political basis</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The postmaster-general looks to all those under his
direction and control for a cheerful and vigorous co-operation
in the management of the business of the department,
by which they will not only render an essential service to
their country, but assuredly promote their own happiness
and extend their individual reputation. It will give him
pleasure, and it is his fixed purpose, to advance, as occasion
may offer, all such as by their industry, fidelity, and
correct deportment may give character to the department
and enable him to discharge honorably the important
duties with which he is intrusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Kendall and, in fact, all postmaster-generals in
their reports invariably speak of advancing the interest of
honest and trustworthy employees; but we believe that
unless this important and much-desired consideration is
carried out by <i>political influence, anxious expectants will
never enjoy the benefits arising from it</i>.</p>

<p>Postmaster-General Blair made similar promises, which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
like those of others, were not fulfilled, and the writer of
this, among others, was told that an addition to their
salary would follow Postmaster-General Blair&#8217;s promises.
The presumption, however, was that there was not a man
in the whole postal department who came up to the postmaster-general&#8217;s
idea of what constituted &#8220;honesty&#8221; in its
connection with the department. This, however, we do
know, that the noisy, ignorant politicians, those who exercised
an influence over frequenters of rum-shops, were the
men who received the most attention from these functionaries.
Postmaster-General Blair, in his Annual Report
of the Post-Office Department, 1862, winds up with these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my purpose to adhere firmly to my determination
to displace incompetency and indifference wherever found
in official position under my control, without any discrimination
in favor of appointments which I may myself have
made under misinformation of facts. The postal business
must be conducted, if successful, upon the same principles
which control the operations of the upright and sagacious
man of business. The department should adhere to those
officers who have administrative talents and are faithful to
its interests, and should remove those who take no interest
in the efficiency of its service.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is exactly the argument we have used in another
portion of this work in favor of those who are faithful to
the interest of the government and have acquired a thorough
knowledge of their duties. We hope the suggestions
of Mr. Blair will be <i>practically</i> carried out.</p>

<p>Mr. Kendall had to contend against a powerful political
party which was brought to bear upon his time and
patience. The latter was severely tried during the session
of Congress, March, 1839. To all the attacks, however,
which were made upon him, and the various attempts to
accuse him of political partiality in his appointments, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
answered with a clearness and boldness which fully proved
that the attempt to make political capital out of his supposed
malfeasance in office was at best but a &#8220;weak invention
of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was stated that he retained in office a postmaster, &#8220;a
wretch who was guilty of forgery and counterfeiting, and
who escaped the fangs of the law only by turning state&#8217;s
evidence,&#8221; although he had been fully informed of the
facts and knew the character of the man, and that his
reason for retaining him (such a villain) in office was that
he was an active and determined partisan. To this statement
Mr. Kendall replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;These charges appear to have been made on the 28th
of February last. Lucius D. Smith, postmaster at New
Lebanon, Oneida county, New York, the individual referred
to, was removed from office on the 21st of January
last, and the appointment of his successor was officially
announced in the &#8216;Globe&#8217; on the 1st of February last. He
had, therefore, been removed more than a month when
these charges were uttered on the floor of the House.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another portion of this work we have alluded to the
fact of the postal department being made a political one.
It is one of those institutions that is allied to the general
interest of all parties; and for the maintenance of that
interest its political influence should not extend throughout
all its ramifications. It is true, the heads of the department
in many instances, being mere ciphers, might be
with propriety politically disposed of; but the workers in
the office&mdash;the active business-men&mdash;should not step out
from their duties to take part in the active workings of the
party at the expense of the postal interest. And yet, under
the present system, these men <i>must labor</i> in their &#8220;political
vocation&#8221; or lose their position. Their presence at ward-meetings,
their being elected delegates, their lost time at
the polls, are all for their chances of retaining place for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
four years. Then they pass away into other business, forgotten
by those who used them as their tools while in
office. What are such men, when subject to a system like
this, but <i>political paupers</i>? We do not say that men in
the post-office should not be the friends and supporters of
the party in power: on the contrary, they are expected to
be. But cannot a man be the friend and supporter of the
government under any administration apart from his
political bias, more particularly if he is placed in a position
of honor and trust not easily supplied by another,
without being subject to instant dismissal? Previous to
1860 this should have been a governmental axiom; but the
rebellion changed the whole system, because there arose
a divided sentiment in relation to the union of States,
originating the treasonable idea that secession was a constitutional
principle. Men who advocated this doctrine
were not considered worthy of a place of trust: hence, in the
different post-offices throughout the loyal States, the oath
of allegiance was administered to the employees,&mdash;a most
important movement; for a disloyal clerk would have been
a powerful auxiliary to the rebel cause. Although during
the rebellion&mdash;nay, even up to its very close&mdash;portions of
the press were favorably disposed towards traitors, the
post-office made no distinction in its distribution of newspapers:
unlike the South in its days of <i>slavish</i> triumph
and during the incipient stages of the rebellion, it exercised
no espionage even over the Copperhead presses of the
North,&mdash;an oversight on the part of our government for
which it has dearly paid; for it led to the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln, by furnishing to the South the information
of its having friends in the North. His death,
however, only accelerated the downfall of all their plans
and the final surrender of all their armies.</p>

<p>And here, although perhaps out of place in a work like
this, we ask how an editor, dipping his pen in the black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
blood of treason and tracing the dark lines of crime along
the columns of his paper, could claim postal protection
while aiming to destroy the very power under which he
claimed the right to publish his incendiary sheet?</p>

<p>That press should cease to be considered a part and
portion of an institution when its columns maintain the
right not only to utter treason, but to claim on constitutional
grounds, according to its idea, the privilege of expressing
sentiments calculated to destroy the union of the
States.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>We have alluded to the frequent changes that are made
in our post-offices: we annex parallel passages from the
English post-office administration and that of our own:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f8">ELEMENTS OF THE BRITISH SYSTEM.</p>

<p>In the English postal system there are potential elements
which render it a success, while in ours it is a failure.</p>

<p>One of these elements is that the <i>personnel</i> of their
postal administration is more permanent, and the establishment
is placed purely on a business footing. It is administered
by experienced men. Once thoroughly instructed
in the laws, the regulations, and their duties, the department
measures their claims to office by their continued
fidelity and attention to its interests. In some branches
of the service, candidates are admitted upon both a physical
and mental examination of their qualifications. A medical
officer examines the aspirants for clerkships and for the
places of carriers and laborers. Post-office savings-banks
are connected with the establishment. Provision for life-assurance,
the premiums being deducted from weekly or
monthly wages, is also a part of their system. They thus
combine nearly all interests to procure a permanent and
faithful devotion to duty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p class="center f8">ELEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN POST-OFFICE.</p>

<p>The elements which make up our postal department are
those which politics create. These are constantly changing,
and every change produces its own creatures. The very
resignations are the consequences of these changes, and not
of the desire to secure other employment. Men would
rather owe to themselves the right of leaving a position
than submit to the pompous notice from an official, commencing
with, <i>&#8220;Your services are no longer required,&#8221; &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The number of resignations alone during the year
ending on the 30th of June, 1862, was 2902, the removals
2786, out of 19,973 officers in the loyal States and districts.
The resignations were nearly fifteen per cent. of the whole
number, and resignations and removals combined about
twenty-eight per cent. of the whole number. The new
appointees must acquire a practical postal education before
they can promptly and accurately discharge their duties.
It is evident that a system so liable to constant and large
changes in its administration must be defective in many
elements of completeness. The theory of our government
requires a direct official responsibility to the executive
head, and that the term of office should be limited to the
proper discharge of that responsibility. The principle is
correct. But the proper compensatory principle requires
retention of good officers, as truly as it requires the discharge
of incompetent incumbents. This principle can
be carried into effect only when public sentiment shall be
so clear and uniform as to make itself felt by all public
representatives influencing appointments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Milton Niles.</span>&mdash;This gentleman was born in
Windsor, Connecticut, August 20, 1787, and was bred to
the bar, and went to Hartford in 1816 to practise law; in
1817 he was there concerned in publishing the &#8220;Times,&#8221;
which he edited for a time; in 1820 he was appointed
postmaster at Hartford by President Jackson, and held the
office until made a Senator in Congress in 1835, in which
position he remained until 1839; in 1840 he was appointed
postmaster-general by President Van Buren; in 1842 he
was again elected to the United States Senate, served six
years, retired to private life, and died May 31, 1856.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Granger.</span>&mdash;Born at Suffield, Connecticut,
December 1, 1792; graduated at Yale College in 1811;
admitted to the bar in May, 1816; he was elected a member
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of the New York Legislature in 1825, and again in
1826, 1827, 1829, and 1831; in 1828 he was a candidate
for the office of Lieutenant-Governor, but was defeated;
and in 1830 and again in 1832 he was run for Governor
with the same result; in 1834 he was elected to Congress;
in 1836 he was a candidate for Vice-President, and received
the electoral votes of the States of Massachusetts,
Vermont, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, Indiana, and
Kentucky; he was again elected to Congress in 1838 and
in 1840; appointed postmaster-general March 6, 1841, but
resigned the following September. His successor in Congress
thereupon resigned, and Mr. Granger was again
elected to that body. On the 4th of March, 1843, he finally
retired from public life.</p>

<p>Francis Granger, immediately on entering upon the
duties of his office, made the same discovery as had others
before him,&mdash;that the postal department was not self-sustaining.
Had the postmaster-general been acquainted with
the business of the office before entering upon its duties,
he would have been fully enabled to reconcile the warring
elements of statistics and figures which the books of the
office presented. The post-office department is not a self-sustaining
one, nor will it be until there is a reconstruction
of the whole system. In several portions of this work
we have alluded to some of the causes tending to such
deficiencies, and pointed out the remedy. As this remedy,
however, is connected with certain abuses not unknown to
high officials, it is questionable if any action will ever be
taken upon it. Mr. Granger says, &#8220;When first entering
upon my official duties, my attention was forced to the
constant demands for payment beyond the ability of the
department to pay; and, with a view to ascertain as nearly
as might be its undisputed liabilities and probable means,
on the 21st of March [1841] last a letter was addressed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the Auditor of the Treasury for the post-office department,
requesting from him information on those subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Granger became considerably enlightened, no doubt,
when the auditor furnished him with the following, which
he recognized thus:&mdash;&#8220;By an examination of that statement,
it will be seen that there was due and unpaid to
contractors of ascertained balances on the 1st of January
last the sum of $447,029, a considerable portion of which
has been paid from the revenues of the quarter ending on
the 31st of March. A report from the auditor upon the
outstanding contracts will undoubtedly increase this amount
of indebtedness to a total exceeding <i>half a million</i> of
dollars: in addition to which, heavy demands are frequently
made on the department upon unliquidated
claims.&#8221; ... &#8220;Under these circumstances,&#8221; he asks,
&#8220;how is the department to be sustained under its present
embarrassments? and what are its financial hopes for the
future?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He also states that the amount demanded by railroad
companies for transportation of the mails is more than
two hundred per cent. higher than is paid for coach
service upon the roads connecting links between different
railroad companies upon the same main route, and that,
too, where the night-service upon the railroads is less than
that performed in coaches.&#8221; He illustrates this by the
following:&mdash;&#8220;Boston is one of the most important points
of railroad concentration in the Union. Its business prosperity
is proverbial; and yet in that city the quarter ending
the 31st of March shows, as compared with the corresponding
quarter of the year before, a decrease in postage
receipts of <i>three thousand one hundred and ninety-five
dollars</i>, being double the amount of diminution to be found
within the same time in any other post-office in the nation,
with the single exception of Philadelphia, which is another
great <i>terminus</i> of railroad communication.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles A. Wickliffe.</span>&mdash;Born at Bardstown, Kentucky,
June 8, 1788, and was admitted to the bar at an
early age. He was twice elected to the State legislature
during the war of 1812; he twice volunteered in the
Northwestern army, and was present at the battle of the
Thames; in 1820 he was again elected to the legislature;
in 1822 he was elected to Congress, and was four times
re-elected. During his service in that body he was
appointed by the House as one of the managers in the
impeachment of Judge Peck. Upon leaving Congress in
1833, he was again elected to the legislature, and upon its
assembling was chosen Speaker. In 1834 he was elected
Lieutenant-Governor of the State; and in 1839, by the
death of Governor Clark, he became acting Governor.
He was appointed postmaster-general September 13, 1841.
In 1849 he was chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional
Convention of Kentucky; and under the new Constitution
he was appointed as one of the revisers of the statute laws
of the State.</p>

<p>This gentleman&#8217;s views of the postal department were
more practical and business-like than those of his predecessor.
He says in his report, dated December 2,
1841, &#8220;As has already been remarked, the original design
in the establishment of the post-office department was
that its income should be made to sustain its operations.
That principle ought never to be abandoned. Whilst the
department should not be regarded as a source of revenue
to the nation, it never should become an annual charge to
the treasury. Upon assuming the discharge of the duties
pertaining to the office of postmaster-general, my first
object was to investigate its financial condition; and it
becomes my duty to inform you that I did not find it in
that prosperous state which the demands upon it require.</p>

<p>&#8220;The income of this department is liable to be affected
by the fluctuations of the business of the country. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
increased or depressed in proportion to the increase or
depression of that business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wickliffe also took another sensible view of the
department: he says, &#8220;Besides this cause of fluctuation in
its income, other causes of a reduction, more or less in
every year, may be found in the increased facilities which
the travel upon railroads and steamboats furnishes for the
transmission of letters and newspapers by private conveyance;
secondly, in the great extension, to say nothing of
the abuse, of the <span class="smcap">FRANKING PRIVILEGE</span>; thirdly, in the
recent establishment of what are called private expenses
upon the great mail-routes of the United States; fourthly,
in the frauds practised upon the department in evading by
various devices the payment of the postage imposed by
law.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cave Johnson.</span>&mdash;Born January 11, 1793, in Robertson
county, Tennessee. His opportunities for education
were limited, but made available to the greatest extent.
In his youth he acted as deputy-clerk of the county, his
father being clerk. He was thence led to the study of
the law. In 1813 he was appointed deputy-quartermaster
in a brigade of militia commanded by his father, and
marched into the Creek nation under General Jackson.
He continued in this service until the close of the Creek
War in 1814. In 1816 he was admitted to the bar; in
1817 he was elected by the legislature one of the attorneys-general
of the State, which office he held until elected a
member of Congress in 1829. He was re-elected in 1831,
1833, and 1835, defeated in 1837, again elected in 1839,
1841, and 1843. Appointed postmaster-general March 5,
1845. In 1849 he served for a few months as one of the
circuit judges of Tennessee, and in 1853 was appointed
by the Governor and Senate as President of the Bank of
Tennessee, at Nashville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacob Collamer.</span>&mdash;Born at Troy, New York, about
1792, and removed in childhood to Burlington, Vermont,
with his father; graduated at the State University at that
place in 1810; served during the year 1812 a frontier
campaign as a lieutenant in the service of the United
States; admitted to the bar in 1813; practised law for
twenty years, serving frequently in the State legislature.
In 1833 he was elected an associate justice of the Supreme
Court of the State, from which position he voluntarily
retired in 1842. In the course of that period he was also
a member of a convention held to revise the Constitution
of the State. In 1843, elected to Congress to fill a vacancy,
and re-elected for a full term in 1844, and again in 1846.
Appointed postmaster-general March 7, 1849,&mdash;thus forming
one of the Cabinet of President Taylor. He resigned
in 1850, with the rest of the Cabinet, on the death of the
President, and was soon afterwards reappointed on the
Supreme bench of his State, which office he held until
1854, when he was elected a Senator in Congress from
Vermont for six years from 1855; and in 1861 he was
re-elected for the term ending in 1867, serving as chairman
of the Committee on Post-Offices and Post-Roads,
also that on the Library, and as a member of several other
important committees. He received the degree of LL.D.
from the University of Vermont and from Dartmouth
College, New Hampshire.</p>

<p>He died on the 9th of November, 1865, at Woodstock,
Vermont, in the seventy-fourth year of his age. Mr.
Collamer was one of the most distinguished of our statesmen,
and one of the oldest members of the Senate.</p>

Millard Fillmore; removed with the latter to Buffalo in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
1830; admitted to the bar in 1832; appointed First Judge
of the Court of Common Pleas in 1841; in 1845 elected
a member of the State legislature, and in 1846 a member
of Congress. He was appointed postmaster-general July
20, 1850, and in 1852 United States Judge for the
Northern District of New York.</p>

<p>It was during his administration that the change was
made in the rates of postage, by making letter-postage
three cents to every part of the United States, except California
and the Pacific Territories,&mdash;the weight of letter
one-half ounce, and prepaid.</p>

mayor of the city of Middletown, and held other offices
of local trust. In 1845 he was elected a member of Congress,
and re-elected in 1847. He was appointed postmaster-general
September 14, 1852. Died at Middletown,

<p><span class="smcap">James Campbell.</span>&mdash;Born September 1, 1813, in the
city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; admitted to the bar
in 1834, at the age of twenty-one years; in 1841, at the
age of twenty-eight, he was appointed Judge of the Common
Pleas Court for the city and county of Philadelphia,
which position he occupied for the term of nine years; in
1851, when the Constitution of the State was changed,
making the judiciary elective, he was nominated by a
State convention of his party as a candidate for the Supreme
Court of the State, but was defeated after a warmly-contested
and somewhat peculiar contest, securing, however,
176,000 votes; in January, 1852, he was appointed Attorney-General
of Pennsylvania, which he resigned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
assume the duties of postmaster-general: he was appointed
to that office on the 8th of March, 1853.</p>

<p>There was no particular feature in the postal department
to render this gentleman&#8217;s name in its connection popular
during his term of office. It is somewhat curious, however,
that the administrations of Franklin Pierce and
James Buchanan&mdash;<i>both peculiarly political</i>&mdash;should have
furnished to the Southern Confederacy more prominent
men who were engaged with them in office than did all the
other administrations combined. Is this accident, design,
or the effect of their political education under their reign?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aaron Vail Brown.</span>&mdash;Appointed postmaster-general
under James Buchanan&#8217;s administration in 1857; was born
August 15, 1795, in Brunswick county, Virginia; graduated
at the University of North Carolina, at Chapel Hill,
in 1814; studied law and soon commenced practice in
Nashville, Tennessee; he was partner in the law business
of the late President Polk; served in almost all the sessions
of the legislature of Tennessee between 1821 and
1832; he was a member of the House of Representatives
from 1839 to 1845, and was in that year elected Governor
of Tennessee.</p>

<p>In his first report as postmaster-general, made December
1, 1857, he very modestly stated that, &#8220;entering on the
administration of the Post-Office Department,&#8221; he &#8220;ventured
on no new theories, nor attempted any innovations
on the well-tried system established and practised upon&#8221;
by his predecessors.</p>

<p>It was during his administration that the route from
New York to New Orleans was considerably improved and
transportation facilitated;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> also the mail-service on the

Mississippi River below the Ohio was materially changed
and improved.</p>

<p>The overland mail-service to California by the Southern
route by contract became an agitating subject, and under
proposals approved by an act of Congress, March 3, 1857,
various bids were made by parties for carrying the mail.
The contract was made on the 16th of September, 1857,
with certain parties, at a cost of $600,000 per annum.

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Holt</span> succeeded Aaron Vail Brown, who died
March, 1858, in alluding to which Mr. Holt uses the following
language:&mdash;</p>

<p class="name">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Post-Office Department</span>,<br />
December 3, 1859.
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;In the month of March last, the sudden decease
of my enlightened and deeply-lamented predecessor, immediately
preceded as it was by the death of the Third
Assistant Postmaster-General,&mdash;so long and so honorably
connected with the administration of the postal revenues,&mdash;filled
this department with discouragement and gloom.
Associated with this double calamity came another, which
awakened painful anxieties, not only from its intrinsic
magnitude, but from the fact that the history of the government,
from its foundation, furnished no parallel for
such a disaster. My allusion is, of course, to the failure of
Congress to pass the customary appropriation bill for the
support of the Post-Office Department, whereby, with all
its responsibilities resting upon it and the fulfilment of all
its duties demanded by the country, it was still deprived
of the use of its own revenues, and thus, necessarily, of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
means of complying with its engagements to the faithful
officers toiling in its service. The ordeal so unexpectedly
prepared for it was, in all its aspects, as novel as it was
perplexing; and disquieting apprehensions were naturally
felt for the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was rather discouraging to Mr. Holt, who, however,
displayed much business tact and perseverance under
the circumstances, for he immediately issued the following
notice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap"><big>To Postmasters and other Agents and Employees
of the Post-Office Department.</big></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Congress having failed to make the necessary appropriation
at its last session for the publication of a Manual
of Post-Offices, Laws, and Regulations, now greatly
needed, and the department not having sufficient clerical
force at its disposal for the preparation of such a work, I
have deemed it proper, in accordance with the course pursued
by two of my predecessors, to purchase, for the use
of the department, the necessary number of copies of a
private edition, having first caused an examination to be
made as to its correctness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The volume now sent is adopted as official, and you
will be guided by it accordingly.</p>

<p class="name">&#8220;<span class="smcap">J. Holt</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Post-Office Department</span>, May 15, 1859.&#8221;
</p>

<p class="tb">The consequences resulting from the failure of Congress
to make the necessary appropriation alluded to by Mr.
Holt were materially felt by those who in good faith had
performed their duty, by being compelled to obtain advances
on their claims at a fearful sacrifice. Mr. Holt,
alluding to this, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is to be feared, however, that those whose circumstances
obliged them to dispose of these securities have in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
many cases been compelled to submit to a heavy discount.
I would most earnestly urge upon Congress the necessity
of making an early appropriation to meet all the existing
liabilities of the department. As the faith of the government
has been broken, not only should the principal of
these debts be promptly paid, but interest on them should
also be allowed. In many instances this may prove but
an imperfect indemnity for the damage which the creditors
of the department have actually sustained; but this much,
at least, is due, from the gravest considerations of public
justice and policy, and cannot, in my judgment, be withheld
without national dishonor.&#8221;</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Horatio King</span> was postmaster-general for a short time.
He had, of course, no opportunity of displaying those
qualities which a long connection with the postal department
had enabled him to acquire. The appointment of
Montgomery Blair, which was a settled matter, as the
successor of Mr. Holt, limited his services. Glancing
over official postal documents, we find his name frequently
coupled with important matters in the department. It was
during his short service as postmaster-general that the
celebrated additional articles were made to those of the
convention of March 2, 1857, between the post-office of
the United States and the general post-office of France.
(<i>See Report of the Postmaster-General for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1861.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montgomery Blair.</span>&mdash;This gentleman was appointed
postmaster-general in 1861, forming one of the Cabinet
under the administration of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Perhaps history affords no parallel to the state of affairs
in our country when Abraham Lincoln took the Presidential
chair. Our readers are all familiar with the history
of this rebellion. We will not go over the grounds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
dark and bloody as they are: suffice to say, the blow
was struck, and treason assumed a bold and formidable
front. The Constitution, even from its adoption, with
all its amendments, has ever been a fruitful subject of
dispute, more particularly with those whose interests
were identified with the institution of slavery. To keep
that peculiar institution&mdash;a relic of barbarism&mdash;intact,
with their ideas of labor, men South advocated the
idea that a sovereignty of States and their separate independency
of the Union were guaranteed to them by
the Constitution. This fatal error misled the ignorant:
men of intellect, men educated in the Union, living under
its Constitution and heretofore abiding by its laws, preached
up a Utopian scheme to these misguided men. The South
was to become the Eden of the world, and slavery its
<i>Magna Charta</i>.</p>

<p>In the early part of Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s administration we
edited a paper established for the purpose of maintaining
his position and opposing the spirit of treason working its
way North. We annex the following extract from an
editorial article we wrote in 1861, being one of the editors
of the &#8220;National Guard,&#8221; a paper devoted to the cause
of the Union, the whole Union, and nothing but the
Union:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;When this distinguished man was first nominated for
the Presidency, the grounds taken by the opposition were
his abolition proclivities. Few people in the North were
willing that the institution of slavery should go down
beneath the Lincoln banner, and hence the increased
opposition to the nomination and the powerful efforts to
frustrate his election. <i>He was elected</i>: he became the
President of these United States lawfully in the sight
of men and of nations, and equally so in the sight of
the Almighty. As President of the whole Union he
took his seat. Men who expected to hear the thundertones
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of his official voice, &#8220;down with the South and
slavery,&#8221; were surprised when they read his opinion upon
the subject as President, differing in some respects from
that expressed as a mere citizen. Being President, the
various State interests had to be consulted: the South
was upheaving with the curse of slavery upon it, and four
millions of human beings were crying out for mercy. The
position in which Mr. Lincoln was placed was a most
delicate one: he could not maintain the high fanatical
notions of many Northern men, nor would he indorse
the actions of the Southerners, who feared that if the
administration limited slavery it would ultimately lead to
a decadency in their trade in human flesh. This was the
state of matters when, in his appeal to the people for aid,
he assured the South that he did not intend, in his official
capacity, to interfere with their peculiar institution. Then
the South dashed back the offered cup of peace presented
to them in good faith, and spurned the hand that held it
towards them. They feared the man; they feared the
popular opinion uprising against slavery, and, deeming a
portion of the North favorable to their cause, reared at
once the standard of rebellion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let our readers glance back to that period; let them
take a view of a tall, pale man seated in the chair of state;
let them look into his eyes, his soul, and see and even
hear the beating pulse of the nation&#8217;s heart in his every
fibre; let them look out and over the land and hear the
maniacs of treason crying for his blood; let them look
North, and even there hear the rebel sympathizers breathing
curses loud and deep; let them read the first call for
75,000 troops, written with a nervous hand and a quailing
heart; then look! behold! a nation obeys the call of the
President, and the voice of the Union-loving people cheers
and upholds him in his seat. The rebels find <i>no open
aid North</i>. Covert, treacherous scoundrels, descendants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of traitors, thieves, and murderers, met, it is true, in secret
councils, but soon fell into their earthly hell before the
indignant glance of an aroused people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where now is slavery? Who struck at its very root
and sent it shivering into pieces throughout the land?
The very men who perfected and planned this revolution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serpent-like, they bit themselves, and are now dying
of the poison. Throughout the whole of these trying
scenes&mdash;from the firing on Fort Sumter to the present&mdash;Abraham
Lincoln has stood up firmly and consistently for
the nation. Party questions have been repudiated and all
sectional distinctions laid aside; for he had but one object,
<i>that of saving the Union</i>! If to do this the destruction of
the institution of slavery was necessary, its being powerless,
helpless, and dead cannot be laid to his charge: it
fell a victim to the acts of men who attempted to place it
above the Constitution, and in the doing of which they
have <i>crushed it and themselves out of the Union</i>. Thank
God for this, the only good they have done!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln&#8217;s Cabinet was composed of men who set
themselves to work in earnest. What they have done is
now our country&#8217;s glory, our nation&#8217;s triumph.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair, in his first report, speaking of the commencement
of his term of office, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after the commencement of my term of office,
the country felt the shock of internecine arms. In view
of the great crime attempted against the existence of the
nation, it became the duty of this, in common with the
other departments of the government, to put forth all
its energies to prevent the consummation of that crime.
By the existing laws, all postmasters and mail-carriers, and
all other persons engaged in handling the mails of the
United States, or in clerical service, were required to take</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>
<p>the usual oath of allegiance to this government, as well as
for the faithful performance of their duties. Whenever it
was made apparent by their declarations or by their conduct
that there was a practical repudiation of the obligation of
this oath, whether the party was a postmaster or a postal
contractor, I ordered a removal from office in the one case
and the deprivation of contract in the other. Not only
was it unsafe to intrust the transportation of the mails to
a person who refused or failed to recognize the sanctions
of an oath, but to continue payment of public money to
the enemies of the government and their allies was to give
direct aid and comfort to treason in arms. I could not
thus permit this branch of government to contribute to its
own overthrow. No other course could have reasonably
been expected by such contractors. The <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> observance
of that oath, and the duty of allegiance itself, entered
into and became a condition, a part of the consideration,
of the contract itself. This failing, the department was
equitably and legally discharged from its literal obligations.
Protection on the part of the government and allegiance on
the part of the citizen are correlative, and are conditions
mutually dependent in every contract; and the highest
public interest demanded the rigid enforcement of this rule
of action. Occasional local and transient inconvenience
resulted of necessity, but far less than would reasonably
have been expected. Loyal men everywhere sustained
this action, and speedily furnished the requisite means for
continuing the service without increased expense. These
changes were mainly called for in parts of Virginia and
Maryland and in Kentucky and Missouri.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the same and in neighboring districts the duties of
the appointment-office have been very onerous, from the
great number of changes required in post-offices, according
to changing phases of public sentiment, individual action,
and military occupancy. It is believed that these positions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
with rare exceptions, are now held by men of unquestioned
loyalty. Where such men could not be found, the offices
have been discontinued rather than they should be held
by repudiators of public faith and used for purposes hostile
to the perpetuity of our national institutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 23d of September, 1864, Montgomery Blair
tendered his resignation of the office of postmaster-general,
and the resignation was accepted by the President.</p>

<p>The causes which led to this action on the part of Judge
Blair were of a political character, and of such a nature as
to clash with the opinions of men who could have no feelings
of sympathy with rebels in arms. Among the charges
brought against Blair were those of opposition to the
general acts of the administration. In answer to one of
these, made by the editor of the &#8220;National Republican,&#8221;
the judge wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="name"><small>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, September 26, 1864.
</small></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Editor of the National Republican.&mdash;Dear
Sir</span>:&mdash;The statement contained in your paper and other
journals that my resignation was caused by the resolution
of the Baltimore Convention referring to the Cabinet, has,
I observe, led to the inference that the principles adopted
by that body were objectionable to me. This is not true.
On the contrary, my offers were made in good faith, with a
view to allay animosities among the friends of those principles,
and in order to secure their triumph.</p>

<p class="name">&#8220;Yours, respectfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<span class="smcap">M. Blair</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The editor of the &#8220;United States Mail,&#8221; a most valuable
post-office assistant, published in New York, noticing
Judge Blair&#8217;s resignation and letter, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the official course of Judge Blair as postmaster-general
has furnished no cause of dissatisfaction, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
no connection with his resignation, is a fact vouched for
by the President, who, in his letter of the 23d, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;While it is true that the war does not so greatly add
to the difficulties of your department as to those of some
others, it is yet much to say, as I most truly can, that in
the three years and a half during which you have administered
the general post-office I remember no single complaint
against you in connection therewith.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge Blair&#8217;s administration of the post-office department
has given evidence of a sincere desire to promote the
efficiency of the service, and has been marked by the
introduction of many important improvements and reforms,&mdash;among
them the establishment of the money-order
system and the new travelling post-office, the simplification
of post-office accounts by the substitution of salaries
in lieu of commissions as compensation to postmasters, the
free delivery of letters by carriers, with various other
plans calculated to increase the postal accommodation of
the public and further the interests of the service. He
has been a faithful and efficient head of the department,
and, as such, leaves a record of which he has no cause to
be ashamed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>There is no question whatever that Postmaster-General
Blair studied the interest of the department with an eye
to its future destiny. He nourished it, watched it, and
we may well say the postal tree is now known and appreciated
by its fruit. In 1863 the &#8220;Boston Weekly Gazette&#8221;
thus speaks of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;At a time when war and finance are the all-absorbing
themes, nationally speaking, but little attention is paid to
the most quiet of our government departments, but none
the less important,&mdash;the post-office. Of the management
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
of this department too much cannot be said in its praise.
When every thing is confused with crowded railroads
and the interruption of conveyance threatened by the exigencies
of other public service, every thing proceeds in
the post-office department with almost the regularity of
clock-work. Scarcely a mail fails in its destination, any
more than if peace prevailed in the land and men had
nothing to do but to think of duty connected with transportation
exclusively. We think Postmaster-General
Blair entitled to the warmest praise for this state of things,
that certainly redounds greatly to his credit. No man
has ever filled his position who has received more
unanimity of approval; and not a complaint is heard of
his management. We make these remarks simply because
it has surprised us that our own papers to the farthest
points reach with such regularity and promptness, and
letters from all parts of the country come to us strictly on
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The history of Judge Blair since his resignation is
identified with that of our politics, in which he seems to
take <i>a peaceful interest</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Dennison.</span>&mdash;On the resignation of the Hon.
Montgomery Blair, the President appointed this gentleman
postmaster-general. This appointment, of course, was
made to reconcile political interest and extend to Ohio
the right hand of government friendship, and not from
any great knowledge Mr. Dennison was supposed to have
of postal matters. In this country prominent positions
under government are the result of the recipient&#8217;s <i>status</i>
in political circles. It is, therefore, evident that a knowledge
of its duties is not an important requisite qualification
for the office.</p>

<p>William Dennison was born in the city of Cincinnati,
on the 9th day of November, 1815. His father was well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
known through more than half a century as a popular
and prosperous innkeeper in the young and rapidly growing
city, no citizen in the whole community being more
respected for probity and general worth among the pioneer
settlers of Ohio and their descendants. He took great
pride in his promising son, young William, and largely
devoted his pecuniary means to secure the boy a thorough
and solid classical education. In preparation for his college
course he had the benefit of the best schools and
teachers in his native city, and in the year 1831 he entered
freshman in the Miami University at Oxford, Ohio, then
and now a flourishing and highly-respected institution,
which has educated many of the most prominent and
powerful minds of the great and populous region north
of the Ohio River, among whom are Caleb B. Smith, late
Secretary of the Interior and formerly United States
judge in Indiana, now deceased, Major-General Robert
C. Schenck, Samuel Galloway, William S. Groesbeck,
George E. Pugh, and others of equal note.</p>

<p>In September, 1835, near the close of his twentieth
year, he graduated with high honor to himself and the
university, then under the long successful presidency of
the Rev. R. H. Bishop, D.D., a learned and venerated
Presbyterian clergyman, who had early been induced to
migrate from Scotland to the Northern United States by
the solicitation and in the company of a renowned divine,
John Mason, of the Scotch Presbyterian Church in New
York, who at that time brought over a very useful and
famous little clerical colony to this country.</p>

<p>Young Dennison then immediately returned to Cincinnati,
and there commenced the study of law in the office
of Hon. Nathaniel G. Pendleton (father of the Democratic
candidate for the Vice-Presidency) and Stephen Fales,
one of the most eminent lawyers of the West, in his youth
a classmate of Daniel Webster at Dartmouth College and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
always his intimate personal friend. Completing his
legal studies and admitted to the bar, he began the practice
of his profession in his native city. Soon afterwards
he married the beautiful and highly-educated daughter of
William Neil, of Columbus (the State capital), a famous
and extensive mail-contractor throughout the Northwest,
whose name was very familiar to travellers and newspaper-readers
twenty or thirty years ago, in the days of stage-coaches,
when railroad enterprise was in its infancy at the
West.</p>

<p>In 1840 he formed a law-partnership with the once
famous, but now infamous, Albert Pike, poet, jurist, and
rebel general, Indian savage by adoption and taste, leader
of scalping-parties, &amp;c. In the execution of that arrangement
he removed to Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas.
But the conditions&mdash;moral, intellectual, social, and political&mdash;by
which he found himself there surrounded induced
him, after a brief residence and experience, to
terminate the connection and return to Cincinnati, where
he resumed his professional business. In 1842, at the
earnest solicitation of his father-in-law, he removed to
Columbus, which became thenceforth his home. He was
made solicitor of the Clinton Bank, of that city, then
president of the Bank of Columbus; and he finally
accepted the entire management and control of all the
vast mail-contract and post-road business of Mr. Neil
throughout the region between the Ohio and the great
lakes.</p>

<p>In politics Mr. Dennison was an original Whig. Throughout
the existence of that party organization he was a firm,
consistent, and zealously-active member of it. In 1847
he was elected to a two-years term in the Ohio Senate.
He next served as president of the Columbus &amp; Xenia
Railroad until 1859, when, having been chosen by the
Republican party Governor of the State, he resigned his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
position in connection with corporations. The great rebellion
found him commander-in-chief of Ohio. He immediately
organized and placed at the disposal of the
Federal Government seventy thousand troops, and in offering
them gave to George B. McClellan and William S.
Rosecrans their first commissions as general officers.</p>

<p>Governor Dennison is a working business-man. He is
an impressive orator, tall in person, of courtly but winning
manners. He is a good specimen of a Christian
gentleman, a devoted member of the Protestant Episcopal
Church.</p>

<p>Mr. Dennison, immediately upon entering the precincts
of the postal bureau, commenced the study of the peculiar
as well as intricate business of the department. His active
mind, tact, and general knowledge soon mastered many
of its intricacies, and, with a precision which surprised the
more knowing ones of the office, arranged and alphabeted
its business in such a manner as to facilitate operations
and lessen actual labor. By this time Governor Dennison
is, no doubt, quite familiar with the business of a post-office.</p>

<p class="center f8">MAILS TO CHINA AND JAPAN.</p>

<p>One of the most important postal arrangements under
this gentleman&#8217;s administration is the establishing by
steamships a postal communication with China and Japan.
Congress passed a law, February 17, 1865, authorizing the
postmaster to contract for such conveyance. The tender
of &#8220;The Pacific Mail Steamship Company,&#8221; the only one
offered, was accepted and engaged for the service. The
compensation therefor is $500,000 per annum for the
performance of twelve round trips between San Francisco
and Hong-Kong, China, touching at Honolulu in the
Sandwich Islands, and Kanagawa in Japan.</p>

<p>This is one of the greatest events of the day, and inaugurates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
a new era in the commerce of our country.
Unless the United States, however, unites all her great
advantages and brings them to bear upon her foreign
relations in such a manner as to place her commerce on a
footing with that of other nations, the mere fact of a new
era with these is simply a postal experiment. It is for
us to become masters of the commerce of the world; and
with this line of steamers regularly established, and the
completion of the Pacific Railway, there is nothing to
stand in the way of success.</p>

<p>Postmaster Dennison, taking this view of it, says, in his
annual report, 1864,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other ocean-routes besides the one to Brazil
which can be safely and profitably occupied by American
lines of mail-steamers,&mdash;among which the route between
San Francisco, Japan, and China, at present unoccupied
by foreign mail-packets, is perhaps the most important in
a commercial point of view, and may be made available
in securing to us a large participation in the commerce of
the East, the greater portion of which is now enjoyed by
Great Britain through her mail-steamship connections <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Suez in the Indian Ocean and China Seas.</p>

<p>&#8220;The central position of the United States, between
Eastern Asia and Western Europe, affording routes but
little longer, if any, than those now traversed between
these distant regions, aided by the superior expedition of
railway transportation between the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts, will furnish such facilities as will make their
adoption a practical necessity for the commercial intercourse
between Europe and the populous countries of
Eastern Asia. These considerations, and others which
will readily suggest themselves, render it important that
the Pacific routes properly belonging to us should be
occupied by American mail-steamers, the profits of which,
with the addition of a small subsidy for the mail-service,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
would justify the establishment of one or more steamship-lines
which would be remunerative to the proprietors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the rebellion is ended, those steamers which
were withdrawn during its progress, thus affording foreign
powers all the advantage of ocean lines, will no doubt
resume their voyages for the benefit of our own.</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">XII.<br /><br />

<b>Philadelphia</b>&mdash;1793.</h2>

<p>The prospects of Philadelphia were brightening up
under the influence enterprising men exercised over its
commercial interest; and up to 1794 the manufactures,
trade, and general business were rapidly extending and
improving. Mathew Carey, speaking of our city and
prospects, in a pamphlet published in 1793, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the period of the adoption of the Federal Government,
at which time America was at the lowest ebb of
distress, her situation had progressively become more and
more prosperous. Confidence, formerly banished, was
universally restored. Property of every kind rose to, and
in many instances beyond, its real value; and a few revolving
years exhibited the interesting spectacle of a
young country with a new form of government emerging
from a state which had approached very near to anarchy,
and acquiring all the stability and nerve of the best-toned
and oldest nations.&#8221; In this prosperity, which revived
the almost extinguished hopes of four millions of people,
Philadelphia participated in an eminent degree. Numbers
of new houses in almost every street, built in a neat,
elegant style, adorned, at the same time that they greatly
enlarged, the city. Its population was extending fast:
even at that period the number of vessels that entered the
port was 1050. Philadelphia still retained its predilection
for old sites and associations; for up to this period,
and even long afterwards, the main place of business was
Front and Water Streets, extending along those streets
from Race down to Almond. Front Street below Market,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
extending down to Walnut, was the great commercial
centre of trade. It was here Thomas Bradford, the root
of the present generation of that name, was prominent as
an editor of the newspaper called &#8220;The True American:&#8221;
his office was on the west side of Front Street, below
Market, No. 8. This property was subsequently sold to
John Moss, Esq., upon the site of which he built a store
especially for his business. Bradford sold out &#8220;The True
American&#8221; to Thomas T. Stiles.</p>

<p>In 1791 the post-office was at No. 7 South Front Street,
on the east side. Robert Patton was postmaster: he was
appointed to that position August 25, 1791. In 1793 it
was removed to No. 36, in the very centre of the trade
and commerce of the city.</p>

<p>The building of the &#8220;Insurance Company of North
America&#8221; stood at the southeast corner of Front and
Walnut Streets. Ebenezer Hazard, formerly postmaster-general,
was the Secretary. The custom-house was also
on Front Street near Walnut Street: it occupied seventy-six
feet front, and ran through to Water Street.</p>

<p>Much of the early prosperity of this city was due to
Benjamin Franklin, who early in life made it his dwelling-place.
His business motto was <span class="smcap">PROGRESS</span>.</p>

<p>The fever of 1793, the most malignant scourge our city
ever witnessed, not excepting the cholera of 1832, threw
a saddening gloom over all things, paralyzing the energies
of men and carrying terror among the women and children.
A writer of the time, speaking of it, says, &#8220;The
consternation of the people of Philadelphia at this
period was carried beyond all bounds. Dismay and
affright were visible in almost every person&#8217;s countenance.
Most of those who could by any means make it convenient
fled from the city. Of those who remained, many shut
themselves up in their houses, being afraid to walk the
streets.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>Business was at a stand, if not entirely suspended.
That of the post-office went on as usual. In September,
however, the postmaster informed the public that, in consequence
of the indisposition of two of the letter-carriers
he deemed it necessary to request all those who dwelt south
of and in Chestnut Street, and in Front and Water Streets
and north of Market Street, to call or send for their letters
for a few days. Some of the postmasters in the different
States used the precaution to dip Philadelphia letters into
vinegar with a pair of tongs before they handled them!
Several of the subscribers to Philadelphia papers made
their servants sprinkle them with vinegar and dry them
at the fire before they would venture to touch them.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago, Benjamin Franklin, seeing that
Philadelphia was gradually declining in the scale of progress,
awoke the Rip Van Winkles of Quakerdom by
imparting to them new ideas, furnishing to their mental
view more enlarged notions of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, and inaugurating a system of education and
philosophy which has made his name famous in the world&#8217;s
history.</p>

<p>His connection with the postal department placed it
before the people in a new and improved light, extending
trade and commerce by its means to such an extent that
in the year 1810 Philadelphia was the leading commercial
city in the Union.</p>

<p>Philadelphia, however, lost sight of one important fact
in connection with her commercial interest, and that was
(to use a speculating phrase) &#8220;never to lose a trick&#8221; in the
game of opposition with others. Thus, while New York
was studying the taste of the town in regard to fashions
of dress and works of art, for which European nations
were then celebrated, Philadelphia was engaged in looking
after her manufacturing interests. The consequence was
that in the year 1811 New York, taking advantage of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
seaboard situation, took the lead in importations, and her
market became celebrated for its rich style of dress-goods,
and her stores equally so for their gorgeous display of
Parisian finery. Instantly that current of trade which had
set in so favorably for Philadelphia changed its course to
her rival city, and merchants from the South and West
flocked there for what, we regret to say, our city was
unable to furnish to the extent its facilities afforded.</p>

<p>It seems as if Philadelphia succumbed at once to New
York, and permitted the Western and Southern trade to
pass away from her without a struggle. For years the
commerce of Philadelphia had kept pace with the general
progress of the country, but in a moment of weakness, or
from some local or political cause, her merchants, whose
industry and enterprise had been proverbial in all countries,
gave up their shipping interest to a rival city, which
the latter has successfully maintained ever since. <i>By this
act Philadelphia became an inland city.</i></p>

<p>If we neglected our shipping, it cannot be said we neglected
our manufacturers. They have had ample reason to
be grateful for such encouragement, as the city has the
honor of being considered second to none in the country,&mdash;at
least in this department. We have surpassed New York
in many important branches of mechanics, and excelled
every other city in the Union, perhaps in the world, in
manufacturing locomotives and other essential auxiliaries
to steamboats, railroads, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>As trade and commerce progressed, the postal department
extended its operations, and the Philadelphia post-office
was not behind those of other cities in furthering
the cause of the great postal institution of the country.</p>

<p>The postal boundaries of our country extend over an
area ten times greater than those of England and France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
combined; three times as large as the whole of France,
Britain, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland,
and Denmark together; one and a half times larger
than the Russian Empire, and only one-sixth less than
the area covered by sixty states and empires of Europe.
The entire area in 1853 was 2,983,153 square miles.</p>

<p>Claiming for Philadelphia, and justly, too, credit for its
postal as well as its commercial reputation, we will pass
over some years and bring our readers down to a later
date. First, however, we annex a list of postmasters of
Philadelphia from 1791.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other city in the Union can boast of a list
of names in their postal department of men, both as regards
character and business qualifications, equal to those
we furnish here, and who filled the office with so much
honor and credit. We are not, however, so clannish in
our notions of locality as to include all the names mentioned
here as being entitled to such credit: we make a few
exceptions: those exceptions and the reasons are a part of
the secret history of <i>post-offices</i>. Several of them have
gone to that &#8220;bourn from whence no traveller returns,&#8221;
and those that still <i>live</i> live honored and respected.</p>

<p>The past history of our city shows that the post-office
was but a minor consideration on the part of the historian
who attempted to speak of its institutions. Even those
whose business it was to furnish statistics and local facts
invariably overlooked the post-office. A glance back
through the vista of time presents to the eye a panoramic
view of the buildings which were used for postal purposes;
and a more motley architectural picture scarcely ever presented
itself to sight. From the time Benjamin Franklin
had his office in a portion of his printing-shop to the present,
we cannot find the department ever blessed with even
a decent building for postal purposes until the one now
occupied for that special service was erected.</p>

<p>True, the Old Coffee-House on Second Street was the
centre of trade, and merchants often met there to discuss
commercial matters and secure their foreign papers and
letters: still, it was not calculated for the general business
of the postal service. From 1793, passing along from
street to street, we at last come to Dr. Jayne&#8217;s gloomy
building, where, amid the sound of steam-engines, the
fumes from eating-houses, and the <i>dead-rat</i> smell from
lager-beer saloons, we find the operations of the great
postal business of the city moving on. The very atmosphere
was as injurious to the health of the employees as
its dark and dingy appearance was painful to those who
visited it.</p>

<p>Emerging from this, we come into a new and beautiful
building, erected on Chestnut Street below Fifth. For this
edifice, so conveniently situated, so light and airy, so admirably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
adapted to postal business, the community is solely
indebted to Postmaster <span class="smcap">Cornelius A. Walborn</span>, Esq.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A GLANCE AT THE PHILADELPHIA POST-OFFICE
FROM AN ARCHITECTURAL POINT OF VIEW.</i></h3>

<p>The Philadelphia post-office was completed and ready
for the transaction of business on the 23d of March, 1863.
It is situated on Chestnut Street, between Fourth and Fifth
Streets, adjoining the custom-house. The contrast between
these two buildings is most remarkable: one presents the
view we have in classic illustrations of the Parthenon of
Athens; the other, disdaining all the associations which
the history of Greece and Rome throws around our ideas
of classic architectural beauty, looms up before us, blending
the style of the rural districts of France (<i>Alaon</i>) with that
of the city of Paris in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The Exchange of Paris (<i>La Bourse</i>), in the Rue Vivienne,
seems, at least in part, to have furnished for our post-office
the idea for its architectural construction. This is
more observable in its Attic design, known in the modern
French school as the &#8220;masked Attic.&#8221; The front of the
Philadelphia post-office is cased or veneered with white
marble, and, in connection with the peculiar Attic style,
presents an appearance by no means flattering to the architect
who designed it.</p>

<p>Modern architects consult variety rather than harmony
in drawing their plans. Thus, foreign ornaments of a more
classic form are occasionally mingled with them: hence
we have presented to us an incongruous style, offensive
alike to good taste and judgment.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia post-office reminds us very much of
the Paris post-office (<i>Hotel des Postes</i>), which is situated
east of the Palais Royal: it has a handsome front, but in
its <i>tout ensemble</i> does not present to view much architectural
beauty either in style or design. France, like England,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
never considered the architecture of a country as
being inseparable from its history: hence her public buildings
present to view the combined peculiarities of the
styles and eras of the sixteen different orders which have
marked the progress of architecture since the building of
the great temple of Samos.</p>

<p>In this country, with few exceptions, we have not studied
architecture with an eye to a national feature: on the contrary,
our artists have copied the styles of all nations,
from which designs are made to please the eye only,
without regard to originality or the age in which we live.
This cannot be called an architectural construction, but
rather an adaptation of Grecian models to the buildings
of our own time. <i>There is no originality here.</i></p>

<p>A building may be well arranged for all purposes of
mere convenience, but in reality, if destitute of harmony
in its outward appearance, it cannot be called an architectural
construction. This remark will apply to the
buildings in our country generally, and equally, as stated,
to those of England and France.</p>

<p>If the Philadelphia post-office is devoid of these requisites
as regards its exterior, its interior makes full
amends.</p>

<p>Every department is so constructed and arranged that
there is no clashing or cause of impediment in the general
routine of its business. Each man has his position, each
<i>bureau</i> its place, and over all the chief clerk, from an
elevated position, has an eye to every action and movement
of the employees. To Cornelius A. Walborn, Esq., the
present efficient postmaster [1866], is the department indebted
for the admirable arrangements of the Philadelphia
post-office.</p>

<p>In speaking of the outward appearance of &#8220;our post-office,&#8221;
we may be singular in our ideas of what constitutes
architectural beauty, and others may appreciate what we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
censure. It is not, however, altogether a matter of taste
with us, but a sense of what constitutes harmony. In
every thing that owes its existence to nature alone, there
is harmony. It is, in fact, the music of the spheres joining
chorus with the growth of plants and flowers, which
the ancients believed came blooming into life with music;
or, as the poet says, it may be &#8220;the language of some
other state, born of its memory.&#8221; Thus, in all things
imitative of nature there should be harmony. Why not
in art?</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no other block of buildings in this
city that presents a greater variety of architectural incongruities
than does that wherein stands the Philadelphia
post-office. It may be called a picturesque view of brick,
marble, and mortar thrown together without regard to
order, style, or <i>harmony</i>.</p>

<p>Let the classic reader cast his eyes over the topographical
view of Olympia as seen from the walls of Altis, glancing
down through the &#8220;Sacred Grove&#8221; and along the Alpheus
River: you will see even at that period, 440 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, how
strictly the ancients adhered to harmony. The Temple
of Jupiter and the Prytaneum or Senate-house, although
widely different in their architectural designing, bore nevertheless
a remarkable similarity in style, so as to preserve
what might be termed classic harmony. Near to the
Mount of Saturn stood the Temple of Juno. In the
Temple of Vesta, the Theatre, the Hypodrammon, even
to the Stables of &OElig;nomaus and the Workshop of Phidias,
the same harmonic traits in style and design were observable.
Every thing was classic, every thing artistic.</p>

<p>How is this feature observed with us? Speaking of
the block alluded to above, embracing the custom-house,
the post-office, the Philadelphia Bank, the Farmers&#8217; and
Mechanics&#8217; Bank, &amp;c., perhaps the following scene from
R. B. Sheridan&#8217;s &#8220;School for Scandal&#8221; will give a better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
description of the style of architecture characterizing each
than any thing we could furnish.</p>

<p>The several characters are describing the personal appearance
of a lady:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Crabtree.</i>&mdash;She has the oddest countenance, a collection
of features from all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sir Benjamin.</i>&mdash;She has, indeed, an Irish front.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Crabtree.</i>&mdash;Caledonian locks.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sir Benjamin.</i>&mdash;Dutch nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Crabtree.</i>&mdash;Austrian lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sir Benjamin.</i>&mdash;The complexion of a Spaniard.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Crabtree.</i>&mdash;And teeth <i>&agrave; la Chinoise</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sir Benjamin.</i>&mdash;In short, her face resembles a table
d&#8217;h&ocirc;te at Spa, where no two guests are of a nation.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>OUTSIDE AND INSIDE VIEW OF THE PHILADELPHIA
POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>The outside of a post-office before the opening of its
doors reminds one of a vast sleeping city, cold and calm,
though containing within itself all the elements that make
up a living, sleepless world. As the stars shine down on
the earth and move on in their spheres, so feeble lights
gleam up from the post-office windows to denote that
&#8220;watchers&#8221; of the night are there, and thus, like the
machinery of the great world, move on the wheels of this
epitomized one.</p>

<p>Dull and heavy glide on the hours of night; silence
like that of the prairie rests for a while on and around
the city, save the howl of some watchful dog and the
far-off sound of a tinkling bell. A city at night, wrapped
in the curtains darkness throws around it, is like a vast
sepulchre, and visited alike with ghosts from the <i>spirit</i>-world.
Presently the dark panorama begins to move:
there is an uprising of a long stream of light in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
eastern sky; a vast and mysterious movement, as impulsive
and as sudden as that of light, agitates the city;
sounds quick and incessant come upon the ear,&mdash;rattling of
wheels, ringing of bells: the world and its inhabitants
are awake. The night dream is over; reality assumes its
power once again. Moving on, men, women, and children
take their respective ways to business or pleasure, for this
world is made up of both. There you see the mechanic,
there the merchant looking for the &#8220;early worm,&#8221; there
the newsboy hurrying to his morning traffic in literature,
himself its evil genius, there the housebreaker moving
quietly away from the scene of his villany, and there the
man of pleasure staggering to his wretched home. There is
one point at which, however, many assemble: there, clustered
around a marbled veneered building,&mdash;for it is not
<i>all marble</i>,&mdash;you can read in the looks of the crowd the
world&#8217;s history, and alike the name of the building: it is
the <span class="smcap">Philadelphia post-office</span>. The sun that awoke
millions from their sleep now shines down and sheds its
light around this &#8220;mimic world:&#8221; it awakes; its night
slumber is over; the hour has arrived&mdash;action, action.
The doors open&mdash;the crowd rush in. Ah! what is life?&mdash;one
scene of struggle and strife, and for what? That&#8217;s the
question.</p>

<p class="center f9">
&#8220;Quid sit futurum eras fuge qu&aelig;rere&#8221;</p>

<p>is not a bad idea of the poet Horace: its literal meaning
is, &#8220;Avoid all inquiry with respect to what may happen
to-morrow.&#8221; We should not look so anxiously into the
future as to preclude all present enjoyment.</p>

<p>Action, action is the motto of our land. This the effect
of a cause,&mdash;that cause the Revolution. It changed alike
men and the opinion of nations upon the subject of sovereignty.
Mental, physical, political, speculative, and financial
revolutions are all the results of one great cause,&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
cause bearing date 1776. Here we are; here in the post-office,
one of the branches of the General Government.
This is the little world of letters, this the index to the
inner history of man. It is a book of thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Deposit-Windows.</span>&mdash;These are surrounded by a
motley crew; letters are dropped in hastily, some carefully
by those who write in doubt and seem to hesitate
the sending until the last moment. Why? Ah! reader,
there is a mystery in all things: here mystery becomes
secrecy. There you see an old lady carefully depositing a
letter: she glances down the opening, takes one last look,
and, sighing, silently moves away. What are the contents
of that letter? It is her secret.</p>

<p>Pass on to the newspaper&mdash;not window; for newspapers
are a wholesale article: singly they are mere letters; in
bulk they are <i>legion</i>. You must go to a door, and there
you will see bags piled Olympus high: these are opened
and distributed into their respective pouches to go to all
parts of the habitable world; for newspapers now are, like
letters, &#8220;the world&#8217;s correspondents.&#8221; The inside of the
office is now wide awake, the world outside is in arms
and &#8220;eager for the fray.&#8221; Millions of letters go and
come, millions of hearts are made glad by a mere stroke
of the pen, which passes lightning-like through this postal
medium, millions of hearts are alike made sad, and
mourn and sob over the one line that brings news of
sickness and of death.</p>

<p>The post-office in many points of view presents the
appearance of a besieged fort. The chief clerk is at his
post: he stands on a platform somewhat elevated above
the line of the main floor; his eye glances along the line
of clerks, some of whom are at the (port-holes) delivery-windows,
awaiting the outward attack. The assault commences,
the windows are assailed. Loud voices are heard,
one above the rest shouts 2400: this is answered by an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
immediate discharge from within, which silences battery
2400. These attacks continue along the &#8220;box line&#8221; until
the demand for surrender on the one side is answered by
a furious discharge of <i>epistolary</i> ammunition on the other.
Both parties retire satisfied with the result. The victory,
however, is always on the side of the post-office: the effect
of the fire from their port-holes is felt when all within its
lines are quiet. The wheels of the department uninjured
move on. Let us take a glance through yonder opening.
We are on the outside, looking into the interior of this
postal fortress. Hundreds of active business-men are
moving about in their shirt-sleeves, looking fierce and
desperate: they are engaged in a great struggle,&mdash;a <i>struggle
with time</i>. Some are dragging along the vast extent of
flooring large leather pouches, others huge canvas bags:
it seems, as you gaze, that they are the bodies of the dead
and wounded, the result of the recent attack. Not so;
they are mail-bags. See how furiously one is thrown
down: it is seized upon as if a victim to be sacrificed.
&#8220;Brass lock,&#8221; yells one. &#8220;Iron,&#8221; screams another. Brass
or iron, they are quickly unlocked, and in an instant their
contents are scattered like chaff, and away they go to the
four quarters of the globe as fast as busy hands, wind,
tide, and steam can take them.</p>

<p>No fort&mdash;not even Sumter, Darling, or the defences of
Vicksburg&mdash;ever presented a more busy scene of life and
death than does the post-office on the opening of mail-bags:
it may indeed be compared to &#8220;life and death;&#8221;
for, as we have said, it is a &#8220;struggle with time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet what to an outsider might seem all chaos,
system has reduced to perfect order; and if the same
observer will look once more into the office after these
sudden attacks on mail-pouches and bags, he will see the
parties sitting quietly down, seemingly well contented with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the result of the strife between <i>time</i>, <i>matter</i>, <i>and motion</i>,&mdash;the
conquerors they.</p>

<p>Mr. William Lewars, author of &#8220;Her Majesty&#8217;s Mails,&#8221;
thus describes the scenes which daily occur from 5.45 to
6 o&#8217;clock in the London post-office:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is then that an impetuous crowd enters the hall,
and letters and newspapers begin to fall in quite a literary
hail-storm. The newspaper-window, ever yawning for
more, is presently surrounded and besieged by an array
of boys of all ages and costumes, together with children
of a larger growth, who are all alike pushing, heaving,
and surging in one great mass. The window with tremendous
gape is assaulted with showers of papers which
fly thicker and faster than the driven snow. Now it is
that small boys of eleven and twelve years of age, panting,
Sinbad-like, under the weight of huge bundles of newspapers,
manage somehow to dart about and make rapid
<i>sorties</i> into other ranks of boys, utterly disregarding the
cries of the official policemen, who vainly endeavor to
reduce the tumult into something like post-office order.
If the lads cannot quietly and easily disembogue, they
will whiz their missiles of intelligence over other people&#8217;s
heads, now and then sweeping off hats and caps with the
force of shot. The gathering every moment increases in
number and intensifies in purpose; arms, legs, sacks,
baskets, heads, bundles, and woollen comforters&mdash;for who
ever saw a veritable newspaper-boy without that appendage?&mdash;seem
to be getting into a state of confusion and
disagreeable communism, and &#8216;yet the cry is still they
come.&#8217; Heaps of papers of widely-opposed political views
are thrown in together; no longer placed carefully in the
openings, they are now sent in in sackfuls and basketfuls,
while over the heads of the surging crowd come flying
back the empty sacks thrown out of the office by the
porters inside. Semi-official legends, with a very strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
smack of probability about them, tell of sundry boys being
thrown in, seized, emptied, and thrown out again <i>void</i>.
As six o&#8217;clock approaches still nearer and nearer, the
turmoil increases more perceptibly, for the intelligent
British public is fully alive to the awful truth that the
post-office officials never allow a minute of grace, and that
&#8220;Newspaper Fair&#8221; must be over when the last stroke of
six is heard. <i>One</i>, in rush files of laggard boys who have
purposely loitered in the hope of a little pleasurable excitement;
<i>two</i>, and grown men hurry in with their last
sacks; <i>three</i>, the struggle resembles nothing so much as a
pantomimic <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>; <i>four</i>, a Babel of tongues vociferating
desperately; <i>five</i>, final and furious showers of papers, sacks,
and bags; and <i>six</i>, when all the windows fall like so many
swords of Damocles, and the slits close with such a sudden
and simultaneous snap, that we naturally suppose it to be
a part of the post-office operations that attempts should
be made to guillotine a score of hands; and then all is
over so far as the outsiders are concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the letter-boxes, scenes somewhat similar have
been enacted. Letters of every shape and color, and of
all weights, have unceasingly poured in; tidings of life
and death, hope and despair, success and failure, triumph
and defeat, joy and sorrow; letters from friends and notes
from lawyers, appeals from children and stern advice from
parents, offers from anxious-hearted young gentlemen and
&#8216;first yeses&#8217; or refusals from young maidens, letters containing
that snug appointment so long promised you, and
&#8216;little bills&#8217; with requests for immediate payments, &#8216;together
with six-and-eightpence;&#8217; cream-colored missives
telling of happy consummations, and black-edged envelopes
telling of death and the grave; sober-looking advice
notes, doubtless telling when &#8216;our Mr. Puffwell&#8217; would do
himself the honor of calling upon you, and elegant-looking
billets, in which business is never mentioned, all jostled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
each other for a short time; but the stream of gladness and
of woe was stopped, at least for one night, when the last
stroke of six was heard. The post-office, like a huge monster,&mdash;to
which one writer has likened it,&mdash;has swallowed
an enormous meal, and, gorged to the full, it must now
commence the process of digestion. While laggard boys,
to whom cartoons by one &#8216;William Hogarth&#8217; should be
shown, are muttering, &#8216;Too late,&#8217; and retiring discomfited,
we, having obtained the requisite &#8216;open sesame,&#8217; will
make our way to the interior of the building. Threading
our course through several passages, we soon find ourselves
among enormous apartments well lit up, where
hundreds of human beings are moving about, lifting,
shuffling, stamping, and sorting huge piles of letters, and
still more enormous piles of newspapers, in what seems
at first sight hopeless confusion, but in what is really the
most admirable order. In the newspaper-room, men
have been engaged not only in emptying the sacks flung
in by strong-armed men and weak-legged boys, but also
in raking up the single papers into large baskets and
conveying them up and down &#8216;hoists&#8217; into various divisions
of the building. Some estimate of the value of
these mechanical appliances, moved, of course, by steam-power,
may be formed from the fact that hundreds of
tons of paper pass up and down these lifts every week.
As many of the newspapers escape from their covers in
the excitement of posting, each night two or three officers
are busily engaged during the whole time of despatch in
endeavoring to restore wrappers to newspapers found
without any address. Great as is the care exercised
in this respect, it will occasionally happen that wrong
newspapers will find their way into loose wrappers not
belonging to them; and, under the circumstances, it would
be by no means a matter of wonder if&mdash;as has been more
than once pointed out&mdash;Mr. Bright should, instead of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
&#8216;Morning Star,&#8217; receive a copy of the &#8216;Saturday Review,&#8217;
or an evangelical curate the &#8216;Guardian&#8217; or &#8216;Punch,&#8217;
in place of his &#8216;Record&#8217; paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the letter-room the officers are no less busily engaged:
a number of them are constantly at work, during
the hours of the despatch, in the operation of placing
each letter with the address and postage-label uppermost,
so as to facilitate the process of stamping. In the general
post-office the stamping is partly effected by machinery
and partly by hand, and consists simply in imprinting
upon each letter the date, hour, and place of posting,
while at the same time the queen&#8217;s head with which the
letter is ornamented and franked gets disfigured. It will
easily be imagined that a letter containing a box of pills
stands a very good chance of being damaged under this
manipulation, as a good stamper will strike about fifty
letters in a minute. Unpaid letters are kept apart, as
they require stamping in a different-colored ink and with
the double postage. Such letters create much extra labor,
and are a source of incessant trouble to the department,
inasmuch as from the time of their posting in London to
their delivery at the Land&#8217;s End or John O&#8217;Groat&#8217;s, every
officer through whose hands they may pass has to keep
a cash account of them. The double postage on such
letters is more than earned by the post-office. All unfastened
and torn letters, too, are picked out and conveyed to
another portion of the large room; and it requires the unremitting
attention of several busy individuals to finish the
work left undone by the British public. It is scarcely credible
that above two hundred and fifty letters are daily posted
<i>open</i>, and bearing not the slightest mark of ever having been
fastened in any way; but such is the fact. A fruitful
source of extra work to this branch of the office arises
through the posting of flimsy boxes containing feathers,
slippers, and other <i>r&eacute;cherch&eacute;</i> articles of female dress, pillboxes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
containing jewelry, and even bottles. The latter,
however, are detained, glass articles and sharp instruments
of any sort, whenever detected, being returned to the
senders. These frail things, thrown in and buried under
the heaps of correspondence, get crushed and broken: yet
all are made up again carefully and resealed.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the letters have been stamped, and those insufficiently
paid picked out, they are carried away to
undergo the process of sorting. In this operation they
are very rapidly divided into &#8216;roads,&#8217; representing a line
of large towns: thus, letters for Derby, Loughborough,
Nottingham, Lincoln, etc., might be placed in companionship
with one division or &#8216;road,&#8217; and Bilston, Wednesbury,
Walsall, West Bromwich, etc., in another.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we have stated, the immense amount of business
transacted in the post-offices of large cities is not unfrequently
lost sight of,&mdash;business transactions of a nature
that few understand or comprehend, and which exercise
an influence on men and nations equally as powerful as
that of the press.</p>

<p>Few persons are acquainted with the inner arrangements
of a post-office. Let any one glance into it as he
passes, and he will be struck with the vast pile of mail-matter
constantly arriving and departing, as well as the
number of hands engaged in their arranging and distributing.
Forty mails arrive and depart in the twenty-four
hours,&mdash;making over three hundred pouches, besides
canvas bags containing newspapers, &amp;c.: these are estimated
more by bulk than numbers.</p>

<p>Mind, intellect, strength, quickness of action and of
thought, are all required here, <i>and found</i>. Without this,
confusion worse confounded would ensue, and the pulsation
of this little world would cease to throb.</p>

<p>A post-office is a little world: it is peopled with the
thoughts of men that go and come, pass and repass, move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
on afar and away over land and water to other cities, and
return again,&mdash;some oppressed, some elated: &#8220;so runs
the world away!&#8221;</p>

<p>What is the romance of a post-office but its reality?
It is a history of letters. Peep into their contents, and you
read a volume far surpassing the wildest flights of the
imagination. And yet they are as a sealed book to all
except those to whom they are directed. Yet you can
read it in the action of the recipients, trace its effects, the
moral is there.</p>

<p>Glance at the ladies&#8217; window: see that tall female, upon
whose face you can trace the dark lines of sorrow. Day
after day has she called, asking in a trembling voice for a
letter. She had told the clerk a sad story of an absent son,&mdash;told
it for the purpose of explaining the cause of her frequent
visits. Did she but know that beneath a blasted
tree, scathed by the lightning flash of a thousand rebel muskets,
he lies buried,&mdash;deep, deep down in the cold ground,
with hundreds of others, both friends and foes, who fell there
in bloody strife. But when the startling news did come,
her tall form was seen no more at that window. She was
alone in the world! Watch that window: it is an index
to a volume of life. Not alone the broken-hearted and
the sorrowing, not alone the forsaken wife and the expectant
maiden, not alone the anxious mother, but the gay,
the frivolous, the abandoned, all flock here; for all are
mixed up in the great struggle of life.</p>

<p>Pass on to the box-window. There you read the history
of men in trade and commerce. There you have a compendium
of that wonderful thing known as and called
&#8216;Change. There you will observe the various and peculiar
characteristics of men as they eagerly clutch their
letters and rush away. Watch their actions, and you will
find that a line or two in a letter convulses the market,
and for a while there is a commotion on &#8217;Change. Watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the politician: by his looks you can read the secret of his
heart. If you follow his footsteps and read the name of
the publication-office into which he plunges, the chief
editorial next day tells its contents. Perhaps it will read,
&#8220;Reliable Intelligence from Richmond. The Rebel Army
well supplied with Ammunition. Probable Recognition
by England, &amp;c.&#8221; Or, perhaps, if the publication-office
should be on Fourth or Third Street, it may read, &#8220;Glorious
News from Grant&#8217;s Army, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is another portion of a post-office which adds
another page to its romantic history; and that is the &#8220;Carriers&#8217;
Department.&#8221; Many a sad tale has the carrier to
tell,&mdash;many a strange incident connected with his &#8220;constant
round.&#8221; A glance into this room shows you a
number of men busily engaged in assorting or &#8220;blocking&#8221;
the letters on their route. These they receive in bulk
from the distributor, which are passed to them from
a smaller room through a series of pigeon-holes. And
here we have a most remarkable illustration of what the
human mind is capable of accomplishing. Let us explain.
In 1854 the corporate limits of the city of Philadelphia
were made coextensive with those of the county, covering
an area of one hundred and twenty square miles, and
placing twenty-one towns and villages under the guardianship
of one Mayor and City Council. In nearly all
of these there were separate post-offices. The bringing of
all these rural districts under one general postal head was
one of the first suggestions that Mr. C. A. Walborn made
to the department shortly after he became postmaster of
this city. Postmaster-General Blair entered fully into
his views upon this subject, and thus the whole rural
district embracing the area named above is under one
general postal head. Mr. Walborn established station-offices,
engaged carriers; and letters are distributed within
an area of over one hundred miles, with as much ease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and facility as they were in the limits of the old city
proper.</p>

<p>For the accommodation of persons residing at points
remote from the general post-office, in Chestnut Street,
stations have been arranged to which four mails are sent
daily. In the extreme rural sections, three daily deliveries
are considered sufficient by the residents, but four collections
are made of matter for delivery or mailing. These
stations are located as follows:&mdash;A, 41 South Eighteenth
Street; B, Market Street, west of Thirty-Seventh, West
Philadelphia; C, southeast corner of Broad and Coates
Streets; D, 1206 North Third Street; E, corner Richmond
and William Streets, Port Richmond; F, 90 Main Street,
Frankford; G, Main Street, below Railroad Depot, Germantown;
H, Main Street, below Church Lane, Chestnut
Hill; I, Main Street, below Grape, Manayunk; K, Washington
Street, near Fifth.</p>

<p>The carriers deliver letters and papers within the following
bounds:&mdash;Delaware River on the east; Montgomery
county line on the west; upper end of Frankford,
Chestnut Hill, and Andora on the north; Delaware county
line on the south, including the old districts of Kensington,
Port Richmond, Bridesburg, Frankford, Rising Sun,
Nicetown, Germantown, Mount Airy, Chestnut Hill, Falls
of Schuylkill, Manayunk, Leverington, Andora, Blockley,
Haddington, Hestonville, Belmont, and Kingsessing. If
thrown into a square, this would form a territory of about
ten by fifteen miles.</p>

<p>Sixty-three carriers are employed, making four deliveries
daily, within the following boundaries: Delaware River,
Schuylkill River, Canal Street, and York Street. There
are thirty-four persons also employed exclusively in collecting
letters from places of deposit within the same district.
They make five collections daily. The rural districts,
including that territory which is contained within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the limits of Delaware county line on the south, Montgomery
county line on the west, Delaware River on the
east, and on the north the northern boundary of Chestnut
Hill, Germantown, and Frankford, occupy twenty-four
persons, making at least three trips per day to collect and
deliver letters. There is, therefore, a force of one hundred
and twenty-one carriers and collectors employed.</p>

<p>The number of letters received by mail and delivered
by carriers amounted, last quarter, to 1,134,111. They
collected and delivered, in the same period, 389,233 local
or drop letters, making a total delivery of 1,523,344.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The number of papers received by mail and delivered
during this period was 117,010; the number of local or
drop papers was 35,257, giving a total delivered, 152,267.
The number of letters returned from misdirection, removal,
refusal to pay postage, and similar reasons, was 8742.
The number of letters for the mail collected from lamp-posts
and other located boxes of deposit was 744,723;
and the number of newspapers similarly obtained, 59,292,&mdash;a
total of 804,015.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE LETTER-CARRYING SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>But few persons have any adequate idea of the vast
number of letters which day after day pass through the
post-office into the hands of the carrier, to be delivered
at their final destination. The following list gives the
number of letters delivered and collected in the four
largest cities during the month of June, 1865:&mdash;</p>

<p>During the same period there were collected from pillar
or lamp-post boxes 1,294,850 letters.</p>

<p>The annexed statement gives the number of letters
delivered in three principal cities:&mdash;</p>

<p>So, according to this, the amount of business transacted
through the Philadelphia post-office is almost equal to that
of Boston, Baltimore, and Chicago combined. Statistics
further show that it is nearly equal to the combined business
of Brooklyn, St. Louis, Washington, Cincinnati, and
Cleveland.</p>

<p>From the little room which we have termed the &#8220;distribution-room,&#8221;
letters are sent and scattered over the area
named above, to the full amount of 18,000 daily, not
including those called &#8220;city drops.&#8221; The distributor is to
know, <i>or is supposed to know</i>, apart from consulting the
directory, the name of every street, lane, and alley, as
well as their locality, so that he can place the letters so
directed into their separate pigeon-holes, both for the city
carriers and the &#8220;subs.&#8221; He has to observe the limits of
certain routes, and see that his letters do not go astray,
thus causing a delay in the delivery of at least twenty-four
hours. Many letters are received without direction,
and others, again, so imperfectly given that it requires the
exercise of a little of Job&#8217;s patience, assisted by an imperfect
directory, to find out where they actually belong. The
carriers, however, to whom these letters are submitted,
being familiar with the names of persons on their routes,
select from this <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of letters those that they <i>think</i>
belong to the parties to whom they are so carelessly
directed. A good carrier never brings back a letter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the office until he is fully satisfied that it is not on his
route. <i>Philadelphia can boast of such.</i></p>

<p>This retentive quality is also powerfully exercised at
the box-windows. There are 2600 boxes, which we may
say will average six letters each daily, thus making an
aggregate of 15,600. These letters are selected from the
&#8220;pile&#8221; by clerks, who actually know not only the names
of the owners of the boxes, but the names of those who
are entitled to their use,&mdash;as, for instance, the clerks and
porters of the parties engaging them. This is what we
term a wonderful exercise of memory and its practical
application. Newspapers are distributed on the same
principle as are the letters.</p>

<p>The newspaper department of a post-office is one that
may well be called the &#8220;reservoir&#8221; of the press: here
flows all that makes up that vast institution, here comes
the highest standard of our literature, down to the meanest
sheet venality produces. A number of men are constantly
employed in the newspaper room, or, as we term it, &#8220;the
rotunda of literature.&#8221; This is emphatically the wholesale
room; for they deal in bulk. Papers coming singly,
directed to individuals, pass through the same process as
do the letters. The packages directed to neighboring cities
find their way through the &#8220;rotunda&#8221; in canvas bags to
their respective places of destination. Let us here say one
word of</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE PRESS.</i></h3>

<p>It has identified itself with, and forms one of the main
features of, our great republic. Its very liberty is essential
to the nature of a free state. Its complicity and power
claim for it a consideration which no other department of
literature and science, however popular, can attain. The
press of our country is now the medium, if not, in fact,
the very source, of that knowledge of which as a nation
we are so justly proud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The work of the post-office</span> is of such a nature,
changing its character with every new incumbent, that it
is utterly impossible to reduce it to a system of permanent
order during one term of office. Move, however, it must,
right or wrong: hence it is that some portion of its machinery
may get out of order and thus militate against
the probability of reaching perfection. Perfection! and
who seeks perfection in any of the institutions established
by man? Nature alone &#8220;is perfect indeed.&#8221; It
was so from the beginning, not only in its elements and
principles, but in its members and its organs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The post-office,&#8221; says a writer in &#8220;Fraser&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;
for September 2, 1862, &#8220;no longer assumes to be perfect,
and its conductors have renounced their claims to infallibility.
Suggested improvements, if they can sustain the
indispensable test of rigid scrutiny, are welcomed, and not,
as of old, frowned away. The department acts under the
conviction that to thrive it must discard the confidence
heretofore placed in legal prohibitions, and seek its continuance
of prosperity only by deserving it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The English post-office has far better opportunities of
rendering its system more perfect than it is, from the fact
that its clerks are not discharged on every change made in
the heads of the department by the government. They
are fixtures. But in this country no one engaged in a
public office under one administration can calculate being
continued under another.</p>

<p>A clerk in the post-office, being appointed for an especial
duty, troubles himself very little about that of any
other. He takes no interest in the general business or
details of the office, from the fact <i>that his situation is not a
permanent one</i>: hence it is that few postmasters are enabled,
within four years, to bring the office out of the chaos into
which a previous administration had reduced it, so as to
congratulate himself upon making one step towards perfection.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
He has to study the political elements outside
first, and by the time these are reconciled, nearly one-third
of his term has expired. In another portion of this work
we have alluded to this political clog placed against the
wheels of the postal department, and retarding, if not materially
impairing, its social, moral, and financial interests.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LETTER-CARRIERS.</i></h3>

<p>Letter-carriers are a very important class of men,&mdash;important,
we mean, in their connection with the postal
department. We speak of them here because their duties
are not generally known to the public, nor their services
properly appreciated or rewarded by the department.
They are the &#8220;walking posts,&#8221; and carry with them daily
thousands of dollars, which rarely are lost on their way
to the recipients. The instances are so few of dishonest
carriers that we have often been surprised that the fact
has not been recorded ere this, so as it might be placed in
juxtaposition with those <i>&eacute;lite</i> rogues in office who are daily
robbing the government of millions. Is it because they
are generally faithful? or is it because the position of a
letter-carrier is one that requires no consideration from
the department beyond the annual&mdash;rather limited&mdash;stipend
for their services? The letter-carriers of our country
represent a political class: they come forth from their
respective wards under, as it were, leading politicians.
The postmaster, in fact, has scarcely a voice in making
these appointments. We have no objection to this system,
as it is one peculiarly allied to the institutions of our
country and mode of election; but we do object to good
and honest men being discharged simply from the fact
that a few politicians outside of an office want to get their
particular friends in. This can scarcely be called rotation
in office, as it frequently assumes an unjust, if not an
intolerant, exercise of power.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>We have alluded to the English post-office as being
perhaps the best-ordered and best-conducted in the world,
<i>for there changes are not made</i>.</p>

<p>In England carriers are classified. The lowest class are
not so well paid, receiving only from 18 to 25 shillings
per week. They are allowed by government, however, to
receive presents, and their Christmas boxes and New-Year
gifts,&mdash;thus realizing a nice little sum of money, as well as
many useful and ornamental articles.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> If the salary of a
letter-carrier in England is not high, the position is so
identified with the governmental patronage that he becomes
a part and portion of the great institution itself.
If he is taken sick, he has medical attendance and medicine
furnished gratis. When unfitted for work, he may
retire upon a pension, for which he has not to pay a
farthing; and during service, if he insure his life for the
benefit of his family, the post-office will assist him to pay
the premium: this is done by allowing him twenty per
cent. on all his payments. Every year the letter-carriers
are allowed a fortnight holiday without any deduction
from their pay. Many spare hours each day may be
devoted to other pursuits; for, if when at work at the
office his hours of duty exceed eight hours daily, he is at
full liberty to ask for investigation and redress. See p.
205, Kendall.</p>

<p>The higher grade of carriers are distinguished from the
lower by wearing a livery of the department and at its
expense, viz.:&mdash;a scarlet coat with a blue collar, and buttons
stamped with an impression of the royal arms. The
carriers of the two-penny post wear the common citizens&#8217;
dress.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>
<p>We have alluded to the general character of the letter-carriers
of our city, and, we may justly and proudly say, of
our country, being equal in point of moral standard, correct
deportment, and honesty of purpose, to any other (public)
class of men in the Union. Of this fact the writer has
opportunities of knowing; and when we take into consideration
the extremely low salaries they receive,&mdash;scarcely
sufficient to support them,&mdash;the fact impresses
itself upon us, as it should on the government, that a
&#8220;<i>carrier&#8217;s fidelity, diligence, and experience should be properly
rewarded.</i>&#8221; We quote here nearly every postmaster-general&#8217;s
language, <i>but as yet the words only stand on the
record</i>!</p>

<p>During the writer&#8217;s connection with the department,
there were but two instances of carriers being detected
in opening letters and appropriating their contents to
their own use. One of these men died suddenly while
under heavy bonds for his appearance at court to answer
for his crime; the other is now expiating his crime in
the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>We have spoken more particularly about carriers and
their general good character; but our remarks will apply
to those who occupy positions in every department, from
the chief clerks down to the wounded soldier who sweeps
out the office.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> It certainly must be a source of satisfaction
to postmasters generally, that peculation, fraud, and
robbery in their departments are of very rare occurrence.
Many losses have been charged to the department, but in
nine cases out of ten they have been traced to parties
<i>who act as carriers between the post-office and merchants&#8217;
counting-houses</i>. These are boys and clerks who are
authorized by merchants to take letters from their boxes,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>
<p>many of which, as we can prove, never reached their
employers, but were opened and the money extracted.
Under the old State laws this was laid down as simply
a breach of trust: it is now made a criminal offence,
and subjects the guilty party to imprisonment. Since the
passage of this law there have been <i>but few such breaches
of trust</i>.</p>

<p>In another portion of this work we have alluded to
the decoy system as being uncalled for and insulting to
the employees. It does seem as if the public and even
postmasters themselves have an idea that <i>dishonesty is a
national calamity</i>, and that it becomes a duty with them
to suspect alike all who are in their employ. Suspicion,
however, is no proof; and we are inclined to think that
many <i>open robberies</i> of the government can be traced to
the fact that high positions <i>seem</i> to sanction the deed.
The poor wretch who steals a loaf of bread to keep his
family from starving finds no mercy at the hands of the
law, while the wholesale robber, the thief of millions, is
simply required to make the amount stolen good! Where
one public official robber is convicted for appropriating
the public funds to his own use, thousands are annually
tried and punished for taking a penny loaf! It is no
wonder, therefore, that suspicion should haunt the guilty
mind, and every man in power judge of others by the
example set in high places.</p>

<p>Some years ago, long before the postal system became
the mighty engine of power that it is now, a Philadelphia
postmaster, since gathered to his fathers, openly stated
that no man should intrust a clerk in the post-office (his
own office) with the knowledge that a letter posted contained
money!</p>

<p>How different is the English post-office in this respect
from ours! There the employees are considered a part
and portion of its national character, identified with it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
by all those ties which protection gives and justice sanctions.
The government not only studies the present interest of
all connected with the postal department, but amply provides
for that of the future. (See p. 147.) Their confidence
is not easily shaken; but like Othello, when they
doubt, they prove; and on the proof there is no more but
this:&mdash;Away at once!</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>IMPORTANT POSTAL TABLES.</i></h3>

<p>The following tables, carefully prepared, fully prove
that there is no surer test of the advance of business and
commercial enterprise than that which is learned from the
increase of postage. A glance at the table from 1790
shows a wonderful increase in the short space of eight or
ten years, entirely unexampled in the history of the world;
and taken in connection, as we think it may be, with a
similar increase in other statistics, it sets all previous examples
completely aside. The fact is, the country is ignorant
of the history of our postal department, a knowledge
of which would tend materially to strengthen that love of
country which a state of ignorance naturally lessens. The
post-office department should no longer be as a sealed
book to the nation.</p>

<p>A letter over 500 miles cost thirty-seven and one-half

our country, traversing mountains, passing deep ravines
and rivers, for the small sum of three cents!</p>

<p>Harpers&#8217; Magazine, had it been in existence in 1815,
would have cost for each one twenty-seven cents, whereas
now they only cost three cents to all parts of the country.
What an age for literature! what an era in learning!</p>

<p>In 1779, in consequence of the increased nature of the
postal business and the necessity for a more extended
ramification of the system, the postmaster-general was to
receive $5000 per annum, and the comptroller $4000,&mdash;meaning,
of course, Continental money. Besides these
two offices in the postal department, there was a secretary
who acted as clerk to the postmaster-general. The comptroller
settled the accounts, and was the book-keeper.
There were three surveyors, who were to travel and inspect
the conduct of the riders, agents, &amp;c. There was also an
inspector of dead letters, at a salary of $100 a year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>What is now called the post-office department was
established in 1789 as the &#8220;post-office,&#8221; and subsequently
as the &#8220;general post-office,&#8221; under the power given to
Congress by the Constitution &#8220;to establish post-offices
and post-roads,&#8221; and the exclusive privilege and control
of all postal affairs, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ORGANIZATION OF THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT.</i></h3>

<p>Congress shall have power &#8220;to establish post-offices and
post-roads.&#8221; This short, concise, yet <i>embracing</i> sentence
sums up the constitutional basis of this department. It
is comprehensive enough to all who fully understand the
economical and practical workings of our government.
Its conciseness is its very history; and that history becomes
a mighty <i>tome</i> in the library of nations.</p>

<p>The direction and management of the post-office department
are assigned by the Constitution to the postmaster-general.
That its business may be the more conveniently
arranged and prepared for its final action, it is distributed
among several bureaus, as follows:&mdash;the Appointment-Office,
in charge of the First Assistant Postmaster-General;
the Contract-Office, in charge of the Second Assistant
Postmaster-General; the Finance-Office, in charge of the
Third Assistant Postmaster-General; and the Inspection-Office,
in charge of the Chief Clerk.</p>

<p>The duties of the several departments named above
are thus defined:&mdash;</p>

<p>The postmaster-general &#8220;is further directed to superintend
the business of the department in all the duties that
are or may be assigned to it, and he is required once in
three months to render to the Secretary of the Treasury an
account of all the receipts and expenditures in the department,
to be adjusted and settled as other accounts.&#8221; The
postmaster-general may establish post-offices and appoint
postmasters on the post-roads which are or may be authorized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
by law, at all such places as to him may appear expedient.
He regulates the number of times the mail shall
go from place to place, and he is authorized to contract
for carrying the mail, and to establish post-roads.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>APPOINTMENT-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>The Appointment-Office not only has supervision of the
appointment and regulation of all postmasters, and the
establishment and discontinuance of post-offices, but also
the distribution of blanks, wrapping-paper, and twine to
all post-offices; the supervision of pay of clerks in post-offices;
of allowance for furniture of post-offices; of extra
allowances to postmasters under the acts of Congress; of
the appointment and pay of special agents, route-agents,
local agents, and blank-agents, and of baggage-masters
in charge of mails; of the foreign mail transportation
and foreign correspondence; together with some other miscellaneous
duties.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>CONTRACT-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>The Contract-Office is charged with the conduct of mail-lettings,
and all contracts and allowances for inland mail
transportation, with the mail messenger service; the supervision
and regulation of mail-contractors, and the
routes of mail-transit, including distributing-offices; and
with the increase and diminution of service on mail-routes.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>FINANCE-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>To this office are assigned the issuing of postage-stamps
and stamped envelopes for the prepayment of postage and
the accounts thereof; the preparation of warrants and
drafts in payment of balances reported by the Auditor to
be due to mail-contractors and other persons; and the
superintendence of the rendition by postmasters of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
quarterly returns of postages. It embraces, also, all the
operations of the dead-letter office, and the accounts connected
therewith.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>INSPECTION-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>The Inspection-Office is charged with the observation of
failures and delinquencies in the service of contractors
and route-agents; with fines and remissions thereof; with
the subject of mail-depredations, and prosecution of violators
of postal laws; with the duty of procuring and distributing
mail-bags, locks and keys, and some other duties
of detail.</p>

<p>Perhaps no institution in this or any other country requires
more enterprise, general knowledge of business,
and geography, than does that of the post-office. We
have already alluded to the fact of its being considered
by many as a &#8220;mere workshop&#8221; of the general department,
and whose operations are simply mechanical; but
our readers ere this have been undeceived as regards such
a construction, and it must loom up before them a prominent
intellectual branch of our government.</p>

<p>That England has a high estimate of her post-office
department is evident from the encouragement given to
every one connected with it, and sustaining alike its literary
character in historic publications. We make the
following extract from a recent work entitled &#8220;Her Majesty&#8217;s
Mails&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no postal service in the world so well managed
as that of Great Britain. It is now not merely a self-supporting
but a productive institution; whereas there
was a deficiency of half a million in the post-office of
America before the rupture between North and South.
Though America for ninety years has been, next to England,
the most commercial country in the world, yet,
compared with the population, five times as many letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
pass through the English post as through the American.
London and its suburbs alone, with its less than three
millions of inhabitants, sends forth a greater number of
letters than the whole of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next best-managed post-office to our own is that of
France; but in France, by the law of 1856, there are
five different tariffs of postages. Judged by the revenue
produced, the English post-office, notwithstanding its low
rate of charges, stands first.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Austrian post-office produces a revenue of 3,714,200
florins, or &pound;378,000; the Belgian, 2,960,000 francs; the
French, 66,452,000 francs; and the English, &pound;3,800,000;
being more than a quarter of a million beyond the proceeds
of 1862.</p>

<p>&#8220;A comparison of the year 1839&mdash;the year immediately
preceding the penny postage&mdash;with the year 1861 gives
these results: An increase nearly eightfold in the chargeable
letters; a threefold increase in the receptacles for
letters; a fortyfold increase in the number of money-orders;
a fiftyfold increase in the amount of money-orders;
and an increase of the gross revenue in round numbers
from &pound;2,390,000 to &pound;3,402,000. The amount of the
correspondence of a country will measure, with some
approach towards accuracy, as Mr. Matthew Hill says,
the height which a people has reached in true civilization.
The town of Manchester equals in its number of letters
the Empire of all the Russias both in Europe and Asia;
and this fact we owe, as many of the marvels we have
stated, to Sir Rowland Hill. The poor and the lowly,
the domestic servant and the humble artisan, can now
correspond with each other from one end of the kingdom
to the other at the trifling expense of 1<i>d.</i>; and for this
civilizing, Christianizing, and eminently social good we
are indebted to a late post-office secretary, whose merits
have been recognized, but who cannot be overpaid in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
money or money&#8217;s worth. As Lord Palmerston said on
the 10th of June, Sir R. Hill showed, in relation to the
post-office, great genius, sagacity, perseverance, and industry,
and he was the first to prove that the department
was a public institution for the performance of services,
rather than for the collection of revenue. If, as the first
minister of the crown stated, and as we believe, the cultivation
of the affections raises men in their own estimation,
improves their morals, and develops their social qualities,
Sir R. Hill has been amongst the greatest benefactors of
the human race, and he well deserves the vote that was
agreed to on the 10th of June without a dissenting
voice.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>POST-COACHES, POST-HORSES, AND RAILROADS.</i></h3>

<p>Postmaster-generals up to the period when railroads
superseded that of post-coaches and post-horses had a
much harder time in their &#8220;vocation&#8221; than have their
successors since. The difficulties then were to overcome
the opposition of parties interested in contracts. Coaches
and post-horses, routes and agents, became important
items in such contracts; and the least favoritism on the
part of the postmaster-general called forth not only censure
from those immediately interested, but not unfrequently
from those high in authority. During the postal
administration of W. T. Barry, Esq., considerable political
feeling was mixed up with these complaints. Mails at
that period (1835) were carried on horseback from central
points, and by four-horse post-coaches from city to city.
Lines of stages were established in several sections of our
country. The number of post-offices was 10,693. The
line of stages extended to the western boundary of Missouri;
to St. Augustine, in Florida; through Indiana, by
the seat of government in that State; through the whole
Territory of Michigan and State of Illinois; from Detroit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
to Chicago; and from Chicago to St. Louis, in Missouri;
thence to New Orleans, in half the time which it formerly
occupied. This facility, however, was afforded by connecting
the coaches with steamboats in the mail-transportation.
Lines of post-coaches were also established in this
year from Nashville to Memphis, on the Mississippi River,
in Tennessee; from Tuscumbia in Alabama to Natchez
in Mississippi; and to Tuscaloosa, the seat of government
in Alabama; and from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery; completing
a direct line from Nashville in Tennessee, and all
the other Western States, to the city of New Orleans.</p>

<p>A semi-weekly line of two-horse stages was added to
a tri-weekly line of four-horse post-coaches from Washington
City, through Lynchburg in Virginia, Salisbury,
N.C., Yorkville, S.C., and Augusta, to Savannah in
Georgia; from thence to the northern part of Georgia,
through that State to Tallahassee, and to Pensacola in
Florida.</p>

<p>We have given this statement for the purpose of showing
the amount of labor essential to the transportation of
the mails at that period, compared to what it is now. It
is, however, somewhat strange that railroads were not established
in many places, which would have obviated the
necessity of coaches.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SOMETHING ABOUT RAILROADS.</i></h3>

<p>Railroads, although evidently of ancient origin, were
first used near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1650. Wooden
rails four to eight inches square, resting upon transverse
sleepers two feet apart, were in use for many years, when
railroads of the same description covered with thin plates
of iron were substituted.</p>

<p>In another part of this work we speak of the lost arts.
Proofs of their existence are found in the excavated cities,
and even in those vestiges which establish the belief of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
an antediluvian state of society equal to any that has
existed since. Egypt abounds with antiquities. Where
are the ramparts of Nineveh, the walls of Babylon, the
palaces of Persepolis, the temples of Baalbec and Jerusalem?
Where are the fleets of Tyre, the docks of Arad,
the looms of Sidon, and the multitude of sailors, pilots,
merchants, and soldiers? Where are those laborers, those
harvests, those flocks, and that crowd of living beings
which then covered the face of the earth?<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The temples are crumbled down, the palaces are overthrown,
the ports are filled up, the cities are destroyed,&mdash;all,&mdash;all.
Earth itself is only a desolate place of tombs.
Yet specimens of high art remain, and also indications of
a classic taste far superior to that which boasts of refinement
since. We have every reason to believe that railroads
were known to the Asiatics long, long before these cities
fell in their ruins, carrying along with them the charts by
which we could have traced their cause of greatness. The
cities of the desert&mdash;that of Palmyra, for instance&mdash;could
never have been built so far away from &#8220;marble-quarries&#8221;
if railroad facilities had not been known and afforded the
means of conveying those vast blocks of marble which
formed its pillars.</p>

<p>The cities of Palmyra and the spot which marks the
site of Tadmor present an imposing spectacle in rising
from the sands of the desert. It looks like a forest of
columns. The great avenue of pillars leading to the
Temple of the Sun, and terminated by a grand arch, is
1200 feet in length. The temple itself is a magnificent
object. The city is a vast collection of ruins, all of white
marble. How were these huge columns of marble conveyed
to this city of the desert?</p>

<p>The sculptures of the Memphite Necropolis say that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Memphis once held a palace called the &#8220;Abode of
Shoopho.&#8221; Shoopho was the owner of vast copper-mines:
he was termed &#8220;pure king and sacred priest.&#8221; Historians
doubted the power he exercised over Egypt, and also the
amount of labor performed in erecting pyramids and
monuments,&mdash;as, for instance, it is maintained that he
employed 100,000 men for twenty years in erecting a
monument for which ten preceding years were requisite
in preparing the materials and the <i>causeway</i> whereon the
stone was to be carried. The monument, as described
by historians, was of immense proportions, the base of
which was 764 feet each face, the original height 480 feet,
containing 89,028,000 cubic feet of solid masonry and
6,848,000 tons of stone. The distance these materials
were carried was twenty miles from the quarries on the
eastern side of the Nile. What sort of a <i>causeway</i> was
that which could transport these huge masses of stone a
distance of twenty miles? Again, this great pyramid is
lined with the most beautiful and massive blocks of
sienite, of red granite, not one particle of which exists
twenty-five miles below the first cataract of the Nile, at
Aswan, distant six hundred and forty miles up the river
from the pyramid. Blocks of this sienite are found in
this pyramid&#8217;s chambers and passages of such dimensions,
and built in such portions of the masonry that they must
evidently have been placed there before the upper limestone
masonry was laid above the granite. There not being in its
native state a speck of granite within six hundred and forty
miles from the pyramid, is a proof that Shoopho did rule
from Memphis to Aswan, and from Migdol to the tower
of Syene. How he conveyed the material that distance
involves the question of the origin of <i>railroads</i>.</p>

<p>Let us pass on to Alexandria. Pompey&#8217;s Pillar stands
upon a pedestal twelve feet high. The shaft is round, and,
with the Corinthian capital, one hundred feet in height;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
the diameter is nine feet. Cleopatra&#8217;s Needle is of one
shaft of granite, covered with hieroglyphics: it is sixty-four
feet high, and eight feet square at the base. There
are a great number of pyramids scattered over Egypt, but
the most remarkable are those of Djizeh, Sakhara, and
Dashour. When seven leagues distant from the spectator
they seem near at hand, and it is not till after having
travelled several miles that he is fully sensible of the size.
The largest is ascribed to Cheops. They are on a platform
of rock situated one hundred and fifty feet above
the level of the desert. Ten years were consumed in preparing
a <i>road</i> whereon to draw the immense blocks of
stone, and the labors of 100,000 men were employed, who
were relieved once in three months.&mdash;<i>Herodotus.</i></p>

<p>What sort of a road and the manner these blocks were
carried are matters of conjecture. <i>We incline to the opinion
of railroads.</i></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>HOW THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT.</i></h3>

<p>The stones used in building the pyramids of Egypt, it
is supposed, were raised to their places by piling up immense
inclined planes of sand, up which the blocks were
pushed with rollers. If inclined planes were used to raise
large blocks to a great height, is it to be supposed that a
similar mode, or <i>railroads</i>, were not used to convey them
on a level plane?</p>

<p>The statement, often repeated on high authority, that
the pyramids were built before the Egyptians acquired the
art of writing hieroglyphics, however, which they do contain,
do not convey that full knowledge of the state of the
arts among them, at the time the pyramids were constructed,
which is to be learned from the writings and pictures in
their tombs and temples, in regard to the state of their arts
at a subsequent period. But we have the less valuable
authority of Herodotus that the blocks of stones were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
lifted from one course to the other up the steps of the
pyramid. Remains of Cheops&#8217; grand causeway, for transporting
the blocks quarried from the rocks on the east
bank, are still seen leading up the great pyramid from the
plain, a shapeless ridge of ruinous masonry and sand.
According to Herodotus, it was one thousand yards long,
sixty feet wide, and forty-eight feet high, was adorned
with figures of animals, and was a work of ten years.
Some of the stone used for the coping over the passages
are seven feet thick and more than seventeen feet long.
Lifting these stones up the side of a pyramid four hundred
and fifty feet high was certainly a work of great labor;
but as a feat of engineering it was mere child&#8217;s play compared
with some of the triumphs of modern science and
skill,&mdash;for instance, lifting the Menai bridge on to its
piers, or raising on end and placing on its pedestal the
monstrous monolith which adorns the city of St. Petersburg.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>RAILROADS FROM 1760&mdash;ENGLAND.</i></h3>

<p>In 1760, wooden railroads were in pretty general use to
facilitate mining operations. Tram-roads, with rails of
cast iron, first introduced at the Colebrookdale Works, at
the instance of Mr. Reynolds in 1767; at the Sheffield
colliery in 1776. Stone props for the support of the rails
substituted for timber in 1797, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Edge rails were brought into use by Mr. Jessop in 1789,
at Loughborough. Malleable iron edge rails adopted at
Newcastle in 1805, and at Tinsdale Fell in 1808. The
improved malleable edge rail now in use was invented by
Mr. Birkinsaw in 1820. A locomotive engine propelled
by steam was employed for the first time on the Merthyr-Tydvil
Railroad in Wales in 1804. Blenkinsop&#8217;s locomotive
engine, which operated by means of cog-wheels
and rack rails, was invented and applied on the Leeds
Railroad in 1811. But the locomotive engine that has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
obtained the greatest reputation and been most generally
adopted was that invented by Mr. George Stevenson in
1814. This engine has undergone a variety of improvements
up to 1829, and was deemed at that period more
efficient than any of its predecessors.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES.</i></h3>

<p class="center f7">(Abstract of the Seventh Census.)</p>

<p>In no other particular can the prosperity of a country
be more strikingly manifested than by the perfection of its
roads and other means of internal communication. The
system of railroads, canals, turnpikes, post-routes, river
navigation, and telegraphs possessed by the United States
presents an indication of its advancement in power and
civilization more wonderful than any other feature of its
progress. In truth, our country in this respect occupies
the first place among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>From returns received at this office in reply to special
circulars, and other sources of information, it is ascertained
that there were, at the commencement of the year 1852,
10,814 miles of railroads completed and in use, and that
10,898 miles were then in course of construction, with a
prospect of being speedily brought into use. While the
whole of these 10,898 miles will, beyond reasonable doubt,
have been finished within five years, such is the activity
with which projects for works of this character are brought
forward and carried into effect, that it is not extravagant
to assume that there will be completed within the limits
of the United States before the year 1860 at least 35,000
miles of railroads.</p>

<p>The Quincy Railroad, for the transportation of granite
from the quarries at Quincy to Neponset River, and the
Mauch Chunk Railroad, from the coal-mines to the Lehigh
River, in Pennsylvania, were the first attempts to introduce
that mode of transportation in this country; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
their construction and opening, in the years 1826 and 1827,
are properly considered the commencement of the American
railroad system. From this period until about the
year 1848, the progress of the improvements thus begun
was interrupted only by the financial revulsion which followed
the events of 1836 and 1837. Up to 1848, it is
stated that about 6000 miles had been finished. Since that
date an addition of 5000 miles has been made to the completed
roads, and, including the present year, new lines,
comprising about 14,000 miles, have been undertaken,
surveyed, and mostly placed under contract.</p>

<p>The usefulness and comparative economy of railroads as
channels of commerce and travel have become so evident
that they have in some measure superseded canals, and are
likely to detract seriously from the importance of navigable
rivers for like purposes. In a new country like ours many
items of expense which go to swell the cost of railroads
in England and on the continent are avoided. Material is
cheap, the right of way usually freely granted, and heavy
land damages seldom interpose to retard the progress of
an important work. It is difficult to arrive at a clear
approximation to the average cost of railroad construction
in the United States. Probably the first important work
of this class undertaken and carried through in the Union
was the cheapest, as it has proved one of the most profitable,
ever built. This was the road from Charleston, in
South Carolina, to Augusta, on the Savannah River. It
was finished and opened for traffic in 1833. The entire
expense of building the road and equipping it with engines
and cars for passengers and freight was, at the date of its
completion, only $6700 per mile; and all expenditures for
repairs and improvements, during the eighteen years that
the road has been in operation, have raised the aggregate
cost of the whole work to only $1,336,615, or less than
$10,000 per mile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>It is estimated that the 2870 miles of railroads finished
in New England have cost $132,000,000,&mdash;which gives an
average of nearly $46,000 per mile. In the Middle States,
where the natural obstacles are somewhat less, the average
expense per mile of the railroads already built is not far
from $40,000. Those now in course of completion&mdash;as
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, Pennsylvania Central,
and other lines, the routes of which cross the Alleghany
range of mountains&mdash;will probably require a larger proportionate
outlay, owing to the heavy expense of grading,
bridging, and tunnelling. In those States where land has
become exceedingly valuable, the cost of extinguishing
private titles to the real estate requires, and the damages
to property along the routes form, a heavy item in the
account of general expenses of building railroads. In the
South and West the case is reversed: there the proprietors
along the proposed line of a road are often willing and
anxious to give as much land as may be needed for its
purposes, and accord many other advantages in order to
secure its location through or in the vicinity of their possessions.
In the States lying in the valleys of the Ohio
and Mississippi the cost of grading, also, is much less than
at the eastward. Where the country is wooded, the timber
can be obtained at the mere cost of removing it from the
track; and through prairie districts Nature seems to have
prepared the way for these structures by removing every
obstacle from the surface; while fine quarries of stone are
to be found in almost every region. These favorable circumstances
render the estimate of $20,000 per mile in all
the new States safe and reliable.</p>

<p>The primary design of nearly all the great lines of railway
in the United States has been to connect the sea-coast
with the distant interior, to effect which object it was
necessary to cross the Alleghanies, which intersect every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
line of travel diverging to the West from the great commercial
cities of the seaboard.</p>

<p>The Eighth Census (1860), continuing the line, makes
this addition to that of the Seventh:&mdash;</p>

<p>Previous to the commencement of the last decade, only
one line of railroad has been completed between tide-water
and the great interior basins of the country, the
products of which now perform so important a part in our
internal and foreign commerce. Even this line, formed
by the several links that now compose the New York
Central Road, was restricted in the carriage of freight
except on the payment of canal tolls in addition to other
charges for transportation, which restriction amounted to
a virtual prohibition. The commerce resulting from our
railroads consequently has been, with comparatively slight
exceptions, a creation of the last decade.</p>

<p>The line next opened, and connecting the Western system
of lakes and rivers with tide-water, was that extending
from Boston to Ogdensburg, composed of distinct links,
the last of which was completed during 1850. The third
was the New York &amp; Erie, which was opened on the 22d
of April, 1851. The fourth in geographical order was
the Pennsylvania, which was completed in 1852, although
its mountain division was not opened till 1854. Previous
to this time its summit was overcome by a series of inclined
planes, with stationary engines, constructed by the
State. The fifth great line, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, was
opened in 1853 still farther south. The Tennessee River,
a tributary of the Mississippi, was reached in 1850 by
the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad of Georgia, and the Mississippi
itself by the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad in
1859. In the extreme north the Atlantic &amp; St. Lawrence,
now known as the Grand Trunk, was completed early in
1853. In 1858 the Virginia system was extended to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
connection with the Memphis &amp; Charleston and with the
Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad.</p>

<p>The eight great works named, connecting the interior
with the seaboard, are the trunks or base-lines upon which
is erected the vast system that now overspreads the whole
country. They serve as outlets to the interior for its products,
which would have little or no commercial value
without improved highways, the cost of transportation
over which does not equal one-tenth that over ordinary
roads. The works named, assisted by the Erie Canal, now
afford ample means for the expeditious and cheap transportation
of produce-seeking Eastern markets, and could
without being overtaxed transport the entire surplus products
of the interior.</p>

<p>Previous to 1850 by far the greater portion of railroads
constructed were in the States bordering the Atlantic, and,
as before remarked, were for the most part isolated lines,
whose limited traffics were altogether local. Up to the
date named, the internal commerce of the country was
conducted almost entirely through <i>water</i> lines, natural and
artificial, and over ordinary highways. The period of
the settlement of California marks really the commencement
of the new era in the physical progress of the United
States. The vast quantities of gold it produced imparted
new life and activity to every portion of the Union, particularly
the Western States, the people of which, at the
commencement of 1850, were thoroughly aroused as to
the value and importance of railroads. Each presented
great facilities for the construction of such works which
promised to be almost equally productive. Enterprises
were undertaken and speedily executed which have literally
converted them into a network of lines, and secured
their advantages to almost every farmer and producer.</p>

<p>The progress of these works in the aggregate, year by
year, will be seen by the tabular statements at the close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of the report. The only important line opened in the
West, previous to 1850, was the one from Sandusky to
Cincinnati, formed by the Mad River and Little Miami
Roads. But these pioneer works were rude, unsubstantial
structures compared with the finished works of the present
day, and were employed almost wholly in the transportation
of passengers.</p>

<p>With the advantages arising from the railroad routes,
it is not at all surprising that our postal facilities have increased
to such an extent that, next to the telegraphic wires,
it may rank as one of the most extraordinary operative
institutions in this or any other country in the world.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that in speaking of the department
the author has paid little or no attention to the rebellion
in connection with its operations. Situated as he is in the
department, his opportunities are such that if the business
of the office has lessened, as is supposed, in consequence,
there is not a man engaged but must truly say that, instead
of such being the case, their labors, as well as the business
of the office, never presented a more stirring and flourishing
appearance. In some respects it may have affected
the general income, but upon the whole the vast increase
of army letters and newspaper circulation, added to sundry
articles of wearing-apparel coming under postal regulations,
we question if this deficiency has not been partially,
if not entirely, overcome. To a certain extent it affected
foreign postage. The following statement, however, will
convey a better idea of the postal finances than that of
any theory established upon &#8220;why and whereof.&#8221; Figures,
they say, never lie; but may not the master-hand forming
them occasionally err in their formation?</p>

<p>The postal revenues for the year ending the 30th of
June last were $12,438,233.78, and the expenditures of this
department during the same period were $12,644,786.20,
showing an excess of the latter of $206,532.42. The average
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
annual receipts of this department from 1859 to 1861,
inclusive, were $8,745,282.62, and the average annual expenditures
for the same period were $14,482,008.44, showing
an average annual excess of expenditures over receipts
of $5,736,725.82; and the average annual receipts from
1862 to 1864, inclusive, were $10,871,530.97, and the expenditures,
$11,694,785.72, showing an average annual
excess of expenditures over receipts of $823,254.75.</p>

<p>The excess of receipts in 1864 over 1861, the first year
of the rebellion, was $4,088,957.38.</p>

<p>Although the proportion of receipts as against the expenditures
has doubtless been increased on account of the
suspension of the postal service in the insurrectionary
States, the above furnishes the evidence of an improving
financial condition of the department highly creditable to
the administration of my immediate predecessor.</p>

<p>The estimate of expenditure for 1864 was fixed at
$13,000,000, in which was included the sum of $1,000,000
specially appropriated for the overland mail-service, being
$355,213.80 more than the amount actually expended.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the revenues of 1864 were estimated
at an increase of five per cent. on those of 1862, making
$8,714,000, while they actually reached $12,438,253.78,
or $3,724,253.73 more than the estimate. This increase
equals 42-5/8 per cent.</p>

<p>The increase of expenditures in 1864, compared with
those of 1863, is 11-5/8 per cent., and the increase in the
revenues for the same year 11-3/8 per cent.</p>

<p>This exhibit promises an increase of the revenues for
1865 over the estimate submitted in the report of last
year.</p>

<p>The revenues of this department for the year ending
June 30, 1865, were $14,556,158.70, and the expenditures
$13,694,728.28, leaving a surplus of $861,430.42.</p>

<p>The ratio of increase of revenue was 17 per cent., and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of expenditure 8 per cent., compared with the previous
year.</p>

<p>The grants for the transportation of free mail-matter

<p>In making the estimate of probable expenditures for

to the terms of a new contract elsewhere referred to
in this report.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>IMPORTANT FACTS.</i></h3>

<p>The maximum annual receipts of the postal department,
previous to the rebellion, from all the States was
$8,518,067.40, which was exceeded in the sum of
$6,038,091.30 by the receipts of the last year from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
loyal States alone. The revenues during the past four
years amounted to $46,458,022.97, an average of
$11,614,505.74 per annum. Compared with the receipts
of the four years immediately preceding, which amounted
to $32,322,640.73, the annual average increase of revenue
was $3,533,845.56, which has not resulted from any considerable
additions to the service, the ratio of receipts to
expenditures having been larger than, with few exceptions,
at any previous period. A proper regard to economy in
administration, aided by larger contributions from all the
States of the Union, will enable the department to increase
its usefulness from year to year in all its legitimate
functions. But it must not be overlooked that the ability
to fully perform its mission as the postal agent of the
Government is greatly impaired by the burdens imposed
by the franking privilege and expensive service upon
routes established for other than postal purposes, the
receipts from which are largely unremunerative. However
much the establishment of these routes is to be commended
for national objects, in which regard they command
the approval of the country, it is not possible to
see upon what principle they are wholly chargeable to the
postal fund, which belongs to those by whom it has been
contributed, and is pledged to meet the wants of the postal
service.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE RAILWAY POSTAL SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>This system, which was suggested by the celebrated
Rowland Hill, originated at a period in English postal
history when the requirements of trade and commerce
demanded a revisal of the code. Perhaps no man was
better qualified for the purpose than was Mr. Hill. In
1839 railroad post-offices were in use for mail-bags. Each
railway company provided a car, when desired to do so
by the postmaster-general, for the exclusive use of the
mails. These cars were fitted up with boxes to facilitate
the distribution and reception of the mails. On the
London and Liverpool Road (1839) it required the constant
and active employment of two clerks to assort,
receive, and hand out the mails: such is the rapidity of
travel, and so numerous are the post-offices upon this
route. Subsequently these cars were used for the distribution
of letters in large cities, by assorting them on
the routes. Not only were such distributions made on
the cars for all the principal stations on the line of the
railroads before the arrival of the cars, but distributions
for the offices connected with the stations, and therefore
incidentally for the entire district of country through which
the lines are in operation. It was some time before our
postal department could be made <i>sensible</i> of the necessity
of the system in our country. Perhaps no other country
in the world possessed a larger amount of railroad travel
and postal extent than ours, and yet the spirit of old
fogyism was hard to be subdued in the encounter Young
America had with it on this subject, nor was it until the
cars were almost forced upon the department (experimentally)
that they were first introduced. These experiments
were made on the routes from Chicago, Illinois, to Clinton,
Davenport, and Dubuque, Iowa, with the most satisfactory
results, as were those between Washington and New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
The attention of the public was called to this new postal
system by the postmaster-general (William Dennison) in
his report for the fiscal year 1864, who stated &#8220;that cars
requisite for the purpose are prepared for one daily line
between New York and Washington, and, by means of
clerks taken temporarily from the post-offices at Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, letters
intended for distribution at either of these points are distributed
in the cars, and so arranged that they can be
despatched without delay on connecting routes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the railroads upon which these cars are placed
are the Pennsylvania Central, between Philadelphia and
Pittsburg: in fact, the system is now so fully established
that it has become an essential element in the whole
organization of the postal department. Those employed
in the several post-offices from which the light of order
radiates, under this new system, can fully appreciate the
advantages resulting from it, as merchants and others
already acknowledge</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;This radiated head of the Ph&oelig;nix,&#8221;</p>

<p>as it rises above the ashes of the old <i>fogy</i> system.</p>

<p>Mail-matter from every direction will reach our citizens
much earlier,&mdash;in most cases several hours sooner. This
will show at once how essential to our merchants is this
new improvement: nor can we at this early period of its
introduction calculate all the advantages likely to result
from it. The idea of a post-office performing its distributing
duties on a railway, going at the rate of thirty
miles an hour, is one of those scintillations of genius which
only emits light once in a century,&mdash;that century the
present.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.</i></h3>

<p class="small">&#8220;I have said so much, that if I had not a frank I must burn my letter and
begin again.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowper.</span></p>

<p>It is the abuse of certain privileges, which all governments
accord to a portion of its officers, which leads to
fraud, crime, and corruption. Among these, that of the
franking system may be ranked as a most prominent one.
Had it been checked at an earlier period of our postal
history, how many evils would have been prevented, and
how far more plethoric would have been its treasury!</p>

<p>As early as 1782, even in its incipient state, far-seeing
men objected to its exercise. In December (6th), 1782,
an ordinance extending the privilege of franking letters
to the heads of all the departments was reported and
taken up. Various ideas were thrown out on the subject
at large,&mdash;some contending for the extension proposed,
some for a total abolition of the privilege as well in
members of Congress as in others, some for a limitation
of the privilege to a definite number or weight of letters.
Those who contended for a total abolition represented the
privilege as productive of abuses, reducing the profits so
low as to prevent the extension of the establishment
throughout the United States, and throwing the whole
burden of the establishment on the mercantile intercourse.
On the other side, it was contended that in case of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
abolition the delegates or their constituents would be
taxed just in proportion to their distance from the seat of
Congress,&mdash;which was neither just nor politic, considering
the many other disadvantages which were inseparable
from that distance; that, as the correspondence of the
delegates was the principal channel through which a
general knowledge of public affairs was diffused, any
abridgment of it would in so far confine this advantage to
the States within the neighborhood of Congress, and that
as the correspondence at present, <i>however voluminous</i>, did
not exclude from the mail any private letters which would
be subject to postage, and if postage was extended to letters
now franked the number and size of them would be
essentially reduced, the revenue was not affected in the
manner represented. The ordinance was disagreed to,
and the subject recommitted with instructions to the committee,
giving them ample latitude for such report as they
should think fit. Whether the report was ever made we
are not advised; but its latitude has increased with the
introduction of every new State and Territory. Since the
above date, almost every postmaster-general has alluded
to the franking privilege. Mr. Blair, in his report of
1863, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I renew the recommendation made last year, that the
franking privilege of postmasters be abolished, except for
correspondence between them and other officers of the
department upon official business.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be abolished also as to the correspondence
of all persons addressed to the several departments and
executive officers of government, except upon official correspondence
addressed by an officer of the government.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both these privileges, as they now exist, have been
much abused, and have no proper place in a correct postal
system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Blair, however, falls into the same error that many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
official rulers commit,&mdash;that of calculating chances of success,
instead of commanding them. In the report alluded
to, we find this passage:&mdash;that &#8220;the postal revenue has
nearly equalled the entire expenditures,&mdash;the latter amounting
to $11,314,206.84, and the former to $11,163,789.59,
leaving a deficiency of but $150,417.25. Good reason,
therefore, exists for the expectation that within a brief
period this important department of the General Government
will become self-sustaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>We do not think so. The postal department is not, nor
can it ever be made, a speculative one. It is based on the
increase of trade and commerce throughout an extent of
country unparalleled in history, as uniting in one system
of rule upwards of thirty millions of people. To keep
up the routes over such a vast space, connecting State to
State, Territory to Territory, passing over lakes, rivers,
mountains, even over the land-route to California, through
almost impassable sections, contending with difficulties
scarcely to be realized in descriptions, the expense is necessarily
great. Previous to 1850 many of the routes
bordering the Atlantic were for the most part isolated
lines, near to which trade and traffic had not approached.
The settlement of California, and the opening of a trade
which has ultimately proved a second Peru, as regards
gold, may be dated as the commencement of a new era
in the physical progress of our country. In connecting
a line of posts, establishing post-offices, and furnishing
modes of conveyance, the question of dollars and cents is
but a secondary consideration. The word profit was repudiated,
and the sole purpose of the government was to
establish the post, no matter at what cost. The time may
come when it shall prove self-sustaining, but never if at
the expense of the public interest, nor while the franking
system exists.</p>

<p>We contend that every letter, document, or newspaper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
no matter by whom mailed, or how high the functionary,
should be prepaid; for men in authority are the servants
of the people, and have no more claim upon the <i>public
treasury</i> than has the lowest worker in any of the departments.
<i>The postal department, however, in its official correspondence,
should be the only exception to the rule.</i></p>

<p>Nor is it the mere privilege we complain of, but its
abuse. Reduce it to an honest and equitable use, and we
venture to say the public will endure the act.</p>

<p>Mr. George Plitt, in his report while a special agent
of the post-office department, made February 3, 1841,
speaking of the franking privilege, says, &#8220;The actual
number of franked packages sent from the post-office of
Washington City during the week ending on the 7th of
July last was 201,534; and the whole number sent
during the last session of Congress amounted to the
enormous quantity of 4,314,948. All these packages
are not only carried by the department into every section
of the country <i>free of charge</i>, but it is actually
obliged to pay to every postmaster whose commissions do
not amount to $2000 per annum, <i>two cents for the delivery
of each one</i>! Supposing all the above to have been delivered,
the department would lose from its revenue for
this one item upwards of $80,000, besides paying for the
mail-transportation.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1834 the &#8220;Washington Globe,&#8221; speaking upon this
subject, used the following language:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Particular cases of gross abuse upon the post-office
are within our knowledge, and the postmaster-general will
be informed of hundreds of others. The opinion of those
acquainted with the subject, which we have no doubt is
correct, is that the department has lost within the last
year, by the extension of the franking privileges of the
members of Congress, and by abuses of law, more than
<i>one hundred thousand dollars</i>. This revenue would in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
short time pay off the debts of the department, and leave
the people all the mails they now have. Who loses this
sum? Not the department only, but the people,&mdash;the
honest correspondents by the post, who prefer paying
postage on their letters to obtaining franks. In fact, the
abuses are growing so rapidly as to justify a fear of their
endangering the establishment. The restrictions of the
law seem to have been by some men wholly borne down
and prostrated, and the franking privilege is rapidly extending
itself over, and covering a great part of, the ordinary
private correspondence of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>The post-office is an establishment of the greatest
utility. The law throws it upon its receipts for postage
as its sole support. When these fail, the mails must
stop; and every dollar that is taken from them is so much
drawn from the service of the public. The duty, therefore,
of protecting the department from the loss of its
revenue is imposed upon the postmaster-general not
only by the general principle of the law, but by the
necessity of saving the establishment from annihilation,
total or partial. The sentiment of the people, ever against
abuse and the improper use of privilege, will sustain the
postmaster-general in his course.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Globe,&#8221; after alluding to the further abuse of
the franking privilege, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the government had been placed upon the footing
of citizens, and had paid during Mr. Barry&#8217;s administration
one-third even of what these would have paid for
the same services, would the department have been in
debt? Strike an account with the executive government
only, even for the last year, and we find that the balance
due to the department, including the losses by abuses,
would more than pay its whole debts. To those, then,
who charge that the department is &#8216;insolvent,&#8217; we say
that its unrequited labors have justly earned for it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
revenue more than sufficient to meet all the demands
against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In connection with this subject,&mdash;and it is one that, when
fully exposed, will astonish the country,&mdash;we annex the
following from the &#8220;American Merchant,&#8221; New York,
for July, 1859. &#8220;There is not the slightest doubt that
very extensive frauds may be successfully carried on in
the department; but we incline to the opinion, however,
that the most aggravated &#8216;frauds&#8217; perpetrated on the
department, and which are the more hard to be borne
that there is no remedy for them under the existing law,
are those which grow out of the franking privilege. It
would astonish the world, could the figures be correctly
ascertained, to see to what extent this evil is carried.
From a statement made by the postmaster of Washington
City to the Post-Office Committee of the House of
Representatives, in January, 1854, we gather the following
items of &#8216;franked&#8217; matter sent during <i>one month</i>
from Washington alone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it be remembered that this amount of $2,500,000,
which is a fair average for one year, is actually <i>taken out</i>
of the revenues of the department in one city. Is it
strange that our postal system should be non-supporting?</p>

<p>&#8220;If it be right that the General Government should defray
the expenses of sending &#8216;pub. docs.&#8217; and the public
and private correspondence of members of Congress to
every part of the country, then a sufficient appropriation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
should be made for that purpose, and there should be
some means of fixing a limit to this system of dead-heading.
And if letters, papers, and public documents were
the only commodities transported under this talismanic
&#8216;frank,&#8217; it would be less a matter of concernment; but
when, as has been the case, members of Congress send
home their dirty linen to be washed, at the expense of the
post-office department, the subject assumes a more serious
aspect, and the sovereign people&mdash;very impudently, perhaps&mdash;persist
in knowing why such things are. From the statements
of the department for the ten years ending with
1856, the total expenses were $68,136,197, and the revenue
from postages $54,014,652, leaving a deficiency of
$14,121,545. The appropriation by government during
the same space was $5,626,682,&mdash;which reduces the actual
deficiency to a little more than $9,000,000.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of the packages thus franked, even when received
by the parties, to whom they are sent, are rarely
opened, for the simple reason that the newspapers (<i>which
also go free</i>) containing the same documents or speeches
have already been received, read, and commented upon.
For instance: it is well known to every member of Congress,
and to every one connected with the post-office, that
long after the President&#8217;s message has been published in
every newspaper throughout the country, thousands upon
thousands are sent daily under frank from Washington.
This was our written objection to the privilege in 1841.
Now the same thing extends to &#8220;Annual Reports&#8221; of the
respective heads of departments, other reports, and speeches
of members of Congress, which are never read in pamphlet
form by the masses to whom they are sent. Many of
these speeches, which attracted no attention in the House
and created little or no sensation out of it, are handsomely
gotten up, neatly printed, artistically stitched, and mailed
by the members at the expense of the government to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
constituents, to whose literary merit and classical beauties
the words of Virgil would most aptly apply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f9">&#8220;Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademtum.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two meanings to this terrible passage from
the Latin poet. The learned reader will apply the less
terrible to the subject in question.</p>

<p>It would present a painful picture were we to sum up
by number, bulk, and character the public documents
which weigh down the mails passing from Washington
City to every other in the country,&mdash;not cities alone, but
towns, villages, hamlets, grog-shops, and places <i>not reputable,
either to the sender or the recipient, to name</i>. Documents,
such as valuable books, find their way as per direction
to ignorant blacks and foreigners, many of whom can
neither read nor write. Wholesale and ponderous as are
these costly matters, they are few in comparison to the
speeches which members of Congress send to their constituents.
We refrain from alluding further to these
matters, as we feel humiliated as a citizen of the United
States when we consider that it is done under the law.</p>

<p>J. Holt, postmaster-general, in his report (1859), speaking
of the franking privilege, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be added, if it is proper that the government
shall be charged with the expense of conveying the matter
now passing free through the mails, justice alike to the
public and to the department requires that the amount
thus due shall be precisely ascertained,&mdash;which can best be
done by prepayment at the mailing-offices. There can be
no enlightened administration of the postal system without
a complete knowledge of its financial resources and liabilities,
which can never be attained while the incubus of
the franking privilege is hanging over it. Under the
stifling pressure, too, of this incubus, the department is
forced to continual efforts to ameliorate its condition, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
must often result in curtailments to be deplored, because
they deprive the public of mail-accommodations for which
they have fully paid, and which they are, therefore, entitled
to enjoy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another potent reason for the abolition of the franking
privilege, as now exercised, is found in the abuses which
seem to be inseparable from its existence. These abuses,
though constantly exposed and animadverted upon for a
series of years, have as constantly increased. It has been
often stated by my predecessors, and is a matter of public
notoriety, that immense masses of packages are transported
under the government frank which neither the letter nor
spirit of the statute creating the franking privilege would
justify; that a large number of letters, documents, and
packages are thus conveyed, covered by the frank of
officials, written, in violation of law, not by themselves,
but by some real or pretended agent; while whole sacks
of similar matter, which have never been handled nor seen
even by government functionaries, are transported under
franks which have been forged. The extreme difficulty
of detecting such forgeries has greatly multiplied this class
of offences, whilst their prevalence has so deadened the
public sentiment in reference to them that a conviction,
however ample the proof, is scarcely possible to be obtained.
The statute of 1825, denouncing the counterfeiting
of an official frank under a heavy penalty, is practically
inoperative.&#8221;</p>

<p>The French deputies and peers have no franking privilege;
in England it was abolished for members of Parliament
since the establishment of the penny post. For an
amusing account of an abuse of the franking privilege in
England, see page 66.</p>

<p>Having expressed our opinion and given that of others
on the abuse of the franking privilege and on the propriety,
in a national point of view, of doing away with it entirely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
it is by no means implied that a different construction of
the right would not do away with our objections, and also
those of the many who consider its abuse a growing, if
not a dangerous, evil. Whatever may be done to lessen
the evil, as well as the heavy expense which it inflicts
upon our government, and which will bring about a state
of things that will redound to the credit of those who
inaugurate a reform in this department of our government,
will be cordially endorsed by the people.</p>

<p>Our members of Congress, it is true, stand politically
very differently as regards positions from the representatives
of other nations; but, still, that is no reason why governmental
privilege should be abused to the extent it is.</p>

<p>By an act of Congress passed at the Third Session of
the Thirty-Seventh Congress, December 1, 1862, to March
4, 1863, &#8220;The postmaster-general may arrange for the
delivery by route-agents of newspaper bundles not taken
from, or intended for, any post-office. The postmaster-general
may regulate the manner of wrapping mail-matter
not paying letter postage, so that it may be easily examined;
and postmasters are allowed to tear off the wrappers to see
if letter postage is evaded. Publishers dealing with the
post-office must swear to their statements: there is a fine
of $50 for each offence in sending papers to other than
subscribers at quarterly rates. The franking privilege is
limited as follows: first, the President, by himself or his
private secretary; second, the Vice-President; third, the
chiefs of the several executive departments; fourth, such
principal officers, being heads of bureaus or chief clerks,
of each executive department, to be used only for official
communications, as the postmaster-general shall prescribe;
fifth, Senators and Representatives, including delegates
from Territories, the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of
the House, to cover correspondence to and from them, and
all printed matter issued by authority of Congress, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
speeches, proceedings, and debates in Congress, and all
printed matter sent to them,&mdash;their franking privilege to
commence with the term for which they are elected, and to
expire on the first Monday of December following such
term of office; sixth, all official communications addressed
to either of the executive departments by an officer responsible
to that department: in all such cases the envelope
should be marked &#8216;official,&#8217; with the signature
thereto of the officer; seventh, postmasters have the
franking privilege for official communications to other
postmasters: in such cases the envelope shall be marked
&#8216;official,&#8217; with the signature of the writer, and for any such
endorsement of &#8216;official&#8217; falsely made, the person making
the same shall forfeit $300; eighth, petitions to either
branch of Congress shall pass free in the mails; ninth, all
communications addressed to any of the franking officers
above described, and not excepted in the foregoing clauses,
must be prepaid by postage-stamps. The franking privilege
shall be limited to packages weighing not exceeding
four ounces, except petitions to Congress and congressional
or executive documents, and publications published, procured,
or purchased by order of either house, which shall
be considered as public documents and entitled to be
franked as such; and except, also, seeds, cuttings, roots,
and scions, the weight of the packages of which may be
fixed by regulations of the postmaster-general. Publishers
of periodicals, magazines, and newspapers which shall not
exceed sixteen ounces in weight shall be allowed to interchange
their publications reciprocally free of postage, such
interchange to be confined to a single copy of each publication.&#8221;</p>

<p>This act took effect July 1, 1863: all acts inconsistent
with it were thereby repealed.</p>

<p>Here is an extensive pull upon the postal department,
yet one that if strictly adhered to would not create such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
an opposition to the system as its abuse has caused.
<i>Barrels of flour, dirty clothes, and other family matters</i>
certainly are not included in the above. If so, then will
the postal department have to connect with its legitimate
business that of an express. A &#8220;National Franking
Privilege Express&#8221; would not be a bad title.</p>

<p>Although the idea of the government becoming a common
carrier of <i>dirty linen, barrels of flour, immense masses
of book-matter and documentary papers</i>, was never entertained,
yet the franking privilege is gradually preparing
the way for its accomplishment. It is, therefore, evident
to us that the system is gradually destroying the whole
theory on which the post-office is founded, and if carried
out still further will cripple its operations materially. It
has been suggested that in lieu of the franking privilege
now allowed by law to members of Congress and others,
they should be furnished with postage-stamps, to be paid
for out of the contingent fund of the House. If the privilege
is to be extended in any shape, let it be under that of
the franking system; for the moment stamps are substituted,
that very moment a rush for &#8220;cash representatives&#8221;
will be most eagerly sought for, and the contingent fund, to
use a modern phrase, will &#8220;be soon swallowed up.&#8221; There
would, of course, be less <i>franking of public documents</i> by
the use of <i>stamps</i>, but a far more extensive use of them
for <i>other purposes</i>. This has been clearly illustrated in
some of our States where the <i>stamps</i> have been substituted
for <i>franking</i>. If, however, the postage-stamp system
should be adopted, let the transmission of books, &amp;c. be
forwarded, under the direction of the Secretary of the
Senate and Clerk of the House, by the ordinary mode of
conveyance. This would be a check on those extravagant
members who consider it a duty due their constituents to
supply them with books enough to make a library. In
one single instance, a member from Utah, in 1858, cost the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
government over seven thousand dollars by the transmission
of books, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As a clear and explicit definition of the limits of the
franking privilege of members of Congress, the following
letter to certain members of Congress who claimed certain
(extended) privileges will be found interesting. The
members had asked leave to frank certain documents
intended to aid a praiseworthy object not strictly entitled
to that privilege, as well as other favors not sanctioned by
either the letter or the spirit of postal laws, rules, and
regulations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="name">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Post-Office Department, 1865.</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Appointment-Office, Washington.</span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I am instructed by the postmaster-general
to acknowledge the receipt of your joint letter of
the 15th instant, and to say that while he fully appreciates
the importance of furnishing the public with correct information
on the subject of the treatment and sufferings
of our brave men who, unfortunately, are prisoners in the
hands of the rebels, and would willingly lend all proper
aid in his power to accomplish this object, he cannot, with
his sense of official duty, direct the postmaster of Boston
to respect at his office the franks of members of the
Senate or House of Representatives while they are sojourning
at the seat of government. Nor can he authorize the
use of <i>fac-simile</i> stamps for the purpose of franking
matter passing through the mails.</p>

<p>&#8220;The franking privilege to Senators and members of
Congress is a personal one, and travels with the party
entitled to it, and cannot be exercised in two or more
places at the same time. By the terms of the law, it is
&#8216;to cover correspondence to and from them, and all printed
matter issued by authority of Congress, and all speeches,
proceedings, debates in Congress, and all printed matter
sent to them,&#8217; thus limiting the privilege to the matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
herein named. Consequently, if it come to <i>the knowledge</i>
of a postmaster that a package bearing a proper frank is
composed of matter not named in the law, it becomes his
duty to disregard such frank and charge postage thereon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The standing regulations of the department provide
that &#8216;no privileged person can authorize his clerk or any
other person to write (or stamp) his name for the purpose
of franking any letter or packet.&#8217; &#8216;The personal privilege
of franking travels with the person possessing it, and can
be exercised in but one place at the same time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No privileged person can leave his frank behind him
to cover his correspondence in his absence.&#8217; &#8216;If letters or
papers be put into a post-office bearing the frank of a
privileged person who notoriously has not been in that
vicinity for several days, ... it is the duty of the
postmaster to treat them as unpaid.&#8217; &#8216;Postmasters are
requested to report to the department all violations of the
franking privilege.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The use of a <i>fac-simile</i> stamp for franking letters or
packets by Senators or members of Congress has never
been authorized or approved by this department in any
way; but, on the contrary, the postmaster-general has
invariably decided against the use of such stamps whenever
the question has been brought to his notice, for the
reason, among others, that it affords opportunity to perpetrate
frauds upon the department and its revenues to an
almost unlimited extent.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the foregoing you will see that the postmaster-general
cannot with consistency or propriety comply with
the request contained in your letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient
servant.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>MAILS ON THE SABBATH.</i></h3>

<p class="center f8">&#8220;Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ever since the postal system was established, an opposition
has been made to its operations on the Sabbath.
It is not for us to question the moral principle upon which
these objections were based. The law for the observance
of the Sabbath comes to us in language that cannot be
mistaken and from a source not to be denied. But we
question whether it applies to the wheels of a government,
which, in the same order as that of the spheres, must
move on for its maintenance.</p>

<p>The Rev. Thomas Scott (whose authority we annex,
not feeling capable of giving a religious view ourselves)
says, speaking upon the subject of the Sabbath,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work,&#8217; was
merely an <i>allowance</i>, and not an <i>injunction</i>; for the Lord
forbade, by other precepts, all labor on some of these days,
but they were assigned for the diligent performance of the
business which relates to this present life, while the
seventh was consecrated to the immediate service of God.
The concerns of our souls must indeed be attended to,
and God worshipped, every day, that our business may be
regulated in subserviency to his will; but on the other
days of the week &#8216;we shall do <i>all our work</i>,&#8217; reserving none
for the Sabbath, except <span class="smcap">WORKS OF CHARITY, PIETY, AND
NECESSITY</span>; for these alone consist with the holiness of that
sacred day of rest, and are allowable, &#8216;because the Sabbath
was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.&#8217; All
works, therefore, which arise from avarice, distrust, luxury,
vanity, and self-indulgence, are entirely prohibited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buying and selling, paying wages, settling accounts,
writing letters of business, reading books on ordinary
subjects, trifling visits, journeys, excursions, dissipation,
or conversation which serves only for amusement, cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
consist with &#8216;keeping a day holy to the Lord;&#8217; and sloth
is a <i>carnal</i>, not a <i>spiritual</i>, rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Servants, and some others, may, however, be under a
real <i>necessity</i> of doing things which are not necessary in
themselves: though good management might often greatly
lessen the evil,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Speaking of cattle, the learned author says, &#8220;The cattle
must also be allowed to rest from the hard labor of husbandry,
journeys, and all employments connected with
trade or pleasure; though doubtless we may employ <i>them
too</i> in works of necessity, piety, and charity; and thus they
may properly be used for the gentle service of conveying
those to places of public worship who could not otherwise
attend or perform the duties to which they are called.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be observed that, indirectly, the author sustains
the argument we advanced above, that the wheels of a
government, like the works of creation, must necessarily
move on &#8220;without impediment,&#8221; and that any labor performed
on the Sabbath connected with such operations
comes under the head of &#8220;necessity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Governments are formed and their laws based upon
those of nature: we imitate and follow them as being
essential to sustaining and perpetuating their stability and
usefulness.</p>

<p>Nor do we think our preachers are disposed to interfere
with the mails running on the Sabbath; for they invariably
are the most anxious on a Monday morning to receive
their letters and newspapers, which, as we all know, are
invariably assorted and distributed throughout the office
on the Sabbath for an early delivery on Monday. <i>We
allude to this important clerical fact because in several instances
they have threatened to report clerks for neglecting
their duties on the Sabbath, simply because that labor was
not devoted, as it would appear, for their especial benefit!</i>
This want of consistency on the part of a portion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
clergy seems more tinctured with hypocrisy than it is
with Christianity.</p>

<p>Return J. Meigs, the postmaster-general under James
Madison in 1815, in reply to certain petitions remonstrating
against the mails running on the Sabbath, makes
use of the following language (we give extracts only):&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220; ... The usage of transporting the mails on the Sabbath
is coeval with the Constitution of the United States;
and a prohibition of that usage will be first considered.&#8221;
He then gives the various mail-routes on the principal
roads, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the mail was not to move on Sunday on the routes
enumerated, it would be delayed from three to four days
in passing from one extreme of the route to the other.
From Washington to St. Louis the mail would be delayed
two days; from Washington to New Orleans the mail
would be delayed three days; from New Orleans to
Boston it would be delayed from four to five days; and,
<i>generally</i>, the mails would, on an average, be retarded
equal to one-seventh part of the time now employed, if
the mails do not move on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the smaller cross-roads or routes the transportation
of the mail has been avoided on the Sabbath, except
when necessary to prevent great delays and to preserve
connections with different routes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In relation to <i>opening</i> the mails on the Sabbath, it may
be noticed that the ninth section of the &#8220;act regulating
the post-office establishment&#8221; makes it the duty of the
postmaster to attend to the duties of his office &#8220;every
day&#8221; on which a mail shall arrive at his office, and at &#8220;all
reasonable hours&#8221; on every day of the week. When a
mail is conveyed on the Sabbath, it must be opened and
exchanged at the offices which it may reach in the course
of the day. This operation at the smaller offices occupies
no more than ten or twelve minutes; in some of the larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
offices it occupies one hour, and, it is believed, does not
greatly interfere with religious exercises as to the postmasters
themselves.</p>

<p>The practice of &#8220;delivering letters and newspapers on
the Sabbath&#8221; is of recent origin, and, under the above-quoted
section, commenced in 1810. Prior to that period,
no postmaster (except the postmaster at Washington City),
was required to deliver letters and newspapers on the
Sabbath. The &#8220;reasonable hours&#8221; were to be determined
by the postmaster-general, who established the following
regulations, now existing:&mdash;&#8220;At post-offices where the mail
arrives on Sunday, the office is to be kept open for the
delivery of letters, &amp;c. for <i>one hour</i> after the arrival and
assorting of the mail; but in case that would interfere
with the hours of public worship, then the office is to be
kept open for one hour after the usual time of dissolving
the meetings for that purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also, if the mail arrives at an office too late for the
delivery of letters on Saturday night, the postmaster is
instructed to deliver them on Sunday morning, at such
early hour as not to encroach upon the hours devoted to
public religious exercises. If these regulations are not
strictly attended to, it must be imputable to the urgency
of applicants and the complaisance of postmasters.</p>

<p>After the preceding statement, it is to be observed that
public policy, pure morality, and undefiled religion combine
in favor of a due observance of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a nation owes to itself an exercise of the
means adapted to its own preservation and for the continuance
of those very blessings which flow from such
observance; and the nation must sometimes operate by a
few of its agents, even on the Sabbath; and such operation
may, as in time of war, become indispensable, so that
the many may enjoy an uninterrupted exercise of religion
in quietude and safety. In the present state of the nation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
it may be supposed necessary <i>daily</i> to convey governmental
orders, instructions, and regulations, and to communicate
and receive information. If the daily carriage
of the mail be as relates to the safety of the nation a
matter of <i>necessity</i>, it also becomes a work of <i>mercy</i>.</p>

<p>When peace is fully established, the necessity will greatly
diminish, and it will be at all times a pleasure to this
department to prevent any profanation of the Sabbath,
as far as relates to its official duty or its official authority.</p>

<p>In England the postal regulations for the Sabbath are
as follows. They differ very little from our own:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;During the time the office is open on Sunday (viz.
from 9 to 10 in the morning, and one other hour), the
public are allowed to prepay foreign and colonial letters,
to purchase stamps, and to have letters registered; and all
other duties are performed as usual, except money-order
and savings-bank business,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> which on that day is wholly
suspended.&#8221;</p>

<p>At no provincial town in England or Ireland is there
more than one delivery on Sunday or the sacramental
fast-days; and any person is at liberty to prevent even
this delivery, so far as relates to himself, as shown by the
following regulations:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1st. Any person can have his letters, &amp;c. retained in
the post-office on Sunday, by addressing to the postmaster
a written request, duly signed, to that effect; and such
request will be held to include newspapers and all other
postal matters, even such as may be marked &#8216;immediate,&#8217;
as no distinction is allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;2d. No letters, &amp;c. the non-delivery of which by the
letter-carrier on Sunday has been directed can be obtained
from the post-office window on that day.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;3d. Private box-holders have the option of applying
for letters at the office while it is open for delivery on
Sunday, or of abstaining from so doing, as they may
think proper; but no person can be permitted to engage
a private box for Sunday only.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would fill a volume were we to attempt any thing
like a history of this department of the general post-office.
One thing, however, would impress itself forcibly
upon the minds of our readers, were we to furnish such a
history, and that would be to establish the fact beyond the
possibility of a doubt that &#8220;the fools are not all dead yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>As far as the employees of the post-office are concerned,
if not irreverent, this would be a &#8220;consummation devoutly
to be wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of these letters, containing important information
and large amounts of money, are so villanously directed
that a modern mesmeriser would find himself at fault, or
a spiritual medium confounded, if put in connection with
the writers, in their endeavor to arrive at the mystery of
such superscriptions as it has been our misfortune to encounter
during our connection with the post-office. In
another portion of this work we furnish the reader with
numerous specimens of such directions. Would we could
give specimens of their chirography also! In connection,
however, with &#8220;dead-letters,&#8221; we annex the following superscriptions

<p>A letter was received in this city by John Smith (we
will not give the real name), containing a draft for three
thousand dollars. The letter simply stated, &#8220;Enclosed
you will find a draft on T&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;, Washington City,
for three thousand dollars, being a part of the proceeds of
property sold. The balance will be forwarded soon, &amp;c.&#8221;
Now, this John Smith was anxiously awaiting the proceeds
of a sale of property in England, he being one of the heirs
expectant, and had been previously notified of the sale in
question. As a matter of course, he imagined this to be the
first instalment, coming as it did from the very town from
which he expected it. The letter was simply directed to
&#8220;John Smith, Catharine Street, Southwark, Philadelphia.&#8221;
The carrier on that route, aware of Smith&#8217;s anxiety to
hear about his property, delivered the letter as directed,
at least as near as it was possible without the number of
the house. Smith opened the letter in presence of the
carrier, and exclaimed, &#8220;It is all right, old fellow!&#8221; The
draft was presented, the money paid, and Smith went on his
way rejoicing. By the time he had spent one-third of the
money, it was discovered that he was not <i>the</i> John Smith.
He returned the two thousand dollars, and the right party
was willing to await John Smith the Second&#8217;s remittance
for his thousand dollars. The cause of this could alone
be attributed to the carelessness of the remitting party in
not giving the particulars or name of the person from
whom the legacy came. The names of the expectants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
being exactly the same, and living on the same street, no
other result could be expected.</p>

<p>The following report of Postmaster Dennison (1865)
furnishes an epitomized view of the dead-letter department:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of dead-letters received, examined, and
disposed of was 4,368,087,&mdash;an increase of 856,262 over
the previous year.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number containing money and remailed to owners
was 42,154, with enclosures amounting to $244,373.97.
Of these, 35,268, containing $210,954.90, were delivered,
leaving 6886 undelivered, with enclosures to the value of
$33,419.07. The number containing sums less than one
dollar was 16,709, amounting to $4647.23, of which 12,698,
containing $3577.62, were delivered to the writers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of registered letters and packages was
3966.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of letters containing checks, bills of exchange,
deeds, and other papers of value was 15,304, with
a nominal value of $3,329,888, of which 13,746, containing
$3,246,149, were delivered, leaving unclaimed 1558,
of the value of $83,739.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number containing photographs, jewelry, and
miscellaneous articles was 69,902. Of these, 41,600 were
delivered, and 28,302 remain for disposal, or, being worthless,
have been destroyed. The number of valuable letters
sent out was 107,979,&mdash;an increase of 38,792 over the
previous year.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were returned to public offices, including franked
letters, 28,677.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number containing stamps and articles of small
value was 8289, and of unpaid and misdirected letters,
166,215.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of ordinary dead-letters returned to the
writers was 1,188,599, and the number not delivered was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
297,304, being about 23 per cent. of the whole. Of those
not delivered, less than 4 per cent. were refused by the
writers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of foreign letters returned was 167,449,
and the number received from foreign countries was
88,361.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the last report the attention of Congress was called
to the expediency of restoring prepaid letters to the owners
free of postage. The measure is again commended, with
the additional suggestion that letters be forwarded at the
request of the party addressed from one post-office to
another without extra charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of letters conveyed in the mails during
1865 is estimated at 467,591,600. Of these, 4,368,087
were returned to the dead-letter-office, including 566,097
army and navy letters, the non-delivery of which was
not chargeable to the postal service, they having passed
beyond its control into the custody of the military and
naval authorities. Deducting 1,156,401 letters returned
to writers or held as valuable, the total number lost or
destroyed was 2,352,424, or one in every two hundred
mailed for transmission and delivery. Fully three-fourths
of the letters returned as dead fail to reach the parties
addressed through faults of the writers, so that the actual
losses from irregularities of service and casualties, ordinary
and incidental to the war, did not exceed one in every
eight hundred of the estimated number intrusted to the
mails.</p>

<p>&#8220;The returns of dead-letters from cities are largely in
excess of proportions based upon population. To them
special efforts have been directed to secure the most efficient
service, and it is believed improvements in operation,
chiefly that of free delivery, will diminish the number
of undelivered letters at offices in densely-populated districts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The number of applications for missing letters was
8664,&mdash;an increase of 3552 over the previous year. A
misapprehension prevails in regarding the dead-letter-office
as a depository for the safe keeping of undelivered letters,
and not as the agent for their final disposal, to correct
which the regulations are appended.</p>

<p>&#8220;The amount deposited in the treasury under act of 3d
of March last were:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than twenty-five per cent. of advertised letters
are delivered. In some of the larger offices the proportion
does not exceed fifteen per cent. The payment of
two cents for each letter advertised involves a yearly expenditure
of about $60,000 for letters returned as dead
to the department. Measures have been adopted to reduce
the expense, and the advertising is now secured at
one-half the rate allowed by law. An obstacle to this
economy is found in the law requiring the list of letters
to be published in newspapers of largest circulation, which
should be repealed, and the mode of advertising left to the
discretion of the postmaster-general.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have stated that imperfect direction is in nine cases
out of ten the cause of the miscarriage of letters. We
would here suggest to the department the propriety of
having competent clerks to superintend this office, so
that the letters returned to the writers should not give
the same cause of complaint. Many of the clerks so employed
make sad havoc of this portion of postal literature,
and exercise little or no judgment in their direction of
letters to the parties to whom they are returned, or at
least for whom they are intended. Name of street and
number of house are alike omitted, and thus a letter comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
from the dead-letter-office as difficult to decipher or make
out as it was when sent thither. Haste in that direction
seems to be the chief cause of this display of hieroglyphical
knowledge.</p>

<p>In the subjoined extracts from a letter which appeared
in the &#8220;Chicago Journal&#8221; (1864) are some practical hints
to letter-writers:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just seen a letter of three pages, and not a
word in it,&mdash;the work of a poor crazed soldier; not a
character of any tongue in Babel, but only a little child&#8217;s
meaningless imitation of writing; and in that letter were
ninety dollars. It came here; the department discovered
the writer, his regiment, and death. The money waits.
Letters sometimes have most interesting histories. Thus,
an officer here in Washington writing a letter to his wife,
who is in New York, simply signed it with his given
name, and carelessly subscribed it &#8216;Washington.&#8217; The
letter came hither; and now who and where was the
writer? In the body of the letter was a chance allusion
to some brigade: &#8216;upon this hint&#8217; the department played
Othello and &#8217;spake.&#8217; The brigade was inquired after and
of, was found, and it answered: the writer was a major,
and was dead. His wife had removed from her old desolate
home, but she was discovered, and the money placed
in her hand as if by the hand of the dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Every</i> letter, no matter what trifles are in it, should
begin with the post-office, State, and poor terrestrial date,
day, month, and year. It is all very fine to write from
&#8216;Clover Lawn,&#8217; or &#8216;Willow-Tree,&#8217; or &#8216;Sweet Home,&#8217; and
date it &#8216;Sunday Eve,&#8217; &#8216;Birthday,&#8217; or &#8216;Moonshine;&#8217; but
suppose the post-mark is dim, and the letter gets into this
marble cemetery, what then? And then as to the superscription.
By the present fashion we have first the name,
life-size, and, if the sex will possibly allow it, Esquired;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
then the post-office; last and least, and tucked in a corner
like a naughty boy, the State.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, is not this reversing the order of things,&mdash;cribbing
the greater and magnifying the less? People, I presume,
will not be persuaded to change their mode of
address, letters dead or alive; but how would it do to
direct a letter thus?&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;<span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span>, <i>Boston</i>,</p>
<p class="center padl5">&#8216;<span class="smcap">Dr. O. W. Holmes</span>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The little traveller would be sure to get into the right
State at the first dash, make straight for the post-office,
and finding the funny doctor would be an easy business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The large number of letters written by persons in the
military service of the United States, whose locality could
not be ascertained, contributed very considerably to the
increase of &#8220;dead-letters.&#8221; But the great proportion of ordinary
dead-letters which were returned was decidedly those
of the careless order. Many were not even signed, and
others so imperfectly directed that it was totally impossible
to decipher even the name or residence of the writer. Time
after time have postmasters called public attention to this
state of things, and, strange as the fact may appear, this
very timely (as it was supposed) suggestion had the contrary
effect: <i>the number of ill-spelt and ill-directed letters
increased!</i></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>PANDORA&#8217;S MAIL-BOX OPENED.</i></h3>

<p>Among the &#8220;mail-matters&#8221; which had accumulated at
the dead-letter-office in Washington since 1848, and which
were sold to the highest bidder on the 6th of December,
1859, were the following articles:&mdash;coats, hats, socks,
drawers, gloves, scarfs, suspenders, patent inhaling-tubes,
gold pens, pencils, ladies&#8217; slippers <i>half worn</i>, all kinds of
jewelry, undersleeves, fans, handkerchiefs, box of dissecting-instruments,
pocket-Bibles, religious books, others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
not quite so acceptable to the moral portion of the community,
shirts, bed-quilts, boots, spurs, gaffs for game-fowls,
shawls, gaiters, tobacco, razors, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ADVERTISED LETTERS.</i></h3>

<p>Advertised letters, uncalled for and sent to the dead-letter-office,
cost the government annually over $60,000!
This is a <i>dead</i> loss, as, from the very nature of the superscription
and imperfect direction, such letters have no
more chance of reaching their places of destination than
a sinner has of going to heaven.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>DECOY-LETTERS.</i></h3>

<p>Devices employed for the public good, if predicated on
the principles that maintain <i>all men dishonest</i> and are themselves
deceptive, both in theory and practice, cannot be
considered either honorable or complimentary to our public
men. The system, more particularly in its connection
with the postal department, originated, we are inclined to
think, from some suspicious postmaster or his chief clerk,
and thus was established a plan to test the employees, alike
unjust and questionable in equity. It is said that these
decoy-letters can never injure honest men. Are we to
understand from this that men of questionable character
and thieving proclivities are employed by the government?
Is it customary to appoint rogues to office, and, after appointing
them, lay traps for their detection? If this is
the fact, then may we well exclaim, with Cowley,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man is to man all kinds of beasts,&mdash;a fawning dog, a
roaring lion, a thieving fox, a robbing wolf, a dissembling
crocodile, a treacherous <i>decoy</i>, a rapacious vulture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once establish the decoy system as a general one, extending
it to all branches of the government, trade, and
commerce, introduce it into stores and factories, and we
shall soon have the flag of suspicion waving over that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
the Stars and Stripes: we will constitute ourselves a nation
of rogues, and become in the eyes of the world a huge
&#8220;<span class="smcap">DECOY DUCK</span>,&#8221; instead of the proud heretofore emblem
of our country, the glorious Eagle!</p>

<p>We care very little about the opinion of Judge Betts,
who on one occasion maintained the principle in a very
<i>learned speech</i>, which when summed up amounted simply
to this, that all men are rogues and require watching,&mdash;in
fact, in morals as well as honesty they are <i>lame ducks</i>,
and a <i>decoy</i> is necessary to watch their actions. The
learned judge said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am persuaded that letters would rarely be intercepted
in their transmission by post if every person concerned
in mailing or carrying them could be impressed
with the idea that each package enclosing valuables may
be but a bait seeking to detect whoever may be dishonest
enough to molest, and to become a swift witness for his
conviction and punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>If this is logic, it lacks one important principle in
theory to establish its practical application, and that is,
<i>common sense</i>. We consider the decoy system, at least as
a national means to detect rogues, beneath the dignity and
character of the nation. Reason and philosophy teach us
that God never puts evil into our hearts, or stirs it up
there by any positive influence. A man is tempted by
his own lust, and enticed into sin by the influence, acts,
and example of wicked men. &#8220;Lead us not into temptation,&#8221;
is one of those wise and holy lessons which the
Saviour of the world instructed his disciples to pray for,
so as they might carry it out in their holy mission,
strengthened by the Divine blessing resting upon it. Men,
however, are not unfrequently placed in situations &#8220;as
have a tendency,&#8221; says Scott, &#8220;to give our inward corruptions
and the temptations of Satan and his agents
peculiar advantage against us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>Is it, therefore, to be wondered at that a government
like ours should assume a Satanic form, and employ agents
for the express purpose of leading men into temptation?
We consider the &#8220;decoy-letter&#8221; system exactly a case in
point. It may not be uninteresting to some of our readers
to give the origin of this ridiculous and equally <i>sinful</i>
manner of testing men&#8217;s honesty.</p>

<p>As might be supposed, it never could have originated
in an enlightened nation, and yet enlightened nations
indorse its antiquity of folly. We trace it to China and
as far back as the dimness of its history can carry us. It
may surprise some to hear the term unenlightened applied
to China, the land of classic works, and the richest and
most important in all Asia. Philosophers have made the
works called &#8220;Kings&#8221; the basis of their labors in morality
and politics. History has always received the attention
of the Chinese, and their annals form the most complete
series extant in any language. Poetry, the drama, and
romantic prose fictions are among the productions of the
Chinese <i>literati</i>,&mdash;&#8220;<i>Liter&aelig; inhumaniores</i>&#8221; meaning learning
rather of an inhuman or barbarous tendency.</p>

<p>The Chinese were in possession of three of the most
important inventions or discoveries of modern times long
before they were known to the nations of the world, besides
which they were the inventors of two remarkable manufactures,&mdash;silk
and porcelain. The art of printing was
practised at least as early as the tenth century; but the use
of movable types instead of blocks seems never to have
occurred to this ingenious people. The knowledge of
gunpowder among them dates at a very early period; but
the application of its use to fire-arms they learned from
the Europeans. Finally, the peculiar directive properties
of the loadstone were applied to purposes of navigation
by the Chinese several centuries before they were employed
in Europe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p>We have given a sketch of the arts and sciences of
China, but it would be totally impossible to give the reader
any thing like an idea of the character and morals of its
inhabitants. When China was first explored by European
travellers it was believed to be a nation that had alone
found out the true secret of government, where the virtues
were developed by the operation of the laws: indeed,
judging from what they had read, an almost perfect people
was expected to greet their sight. Alas! how is history
falsified! Few nations, it is now agreed, have so little
honor or feeling, or so much duplicity, cunning, and mendacity.
Their affected gravity is as far from wisdom as
their ceremonies are from politeness.</p>

<p>The government of China is one of fear; and it has
produced the usual effects,&mdash;duplicity and meanness. Suspicion
is one of their leading features, and thus every man
is not only suspected of being a rogue, but in reality every
one is a rogue. Expert thieving is considered an art, yet
if discovered is punished. The merchants cheat each
other by rule: hence it is not strange that the <span class="smcap">DECOY
SYSTEM</span> should have originated in that country.</p>

<p>Laws were enacted to punish those who laid the decoy,
as well as those who fell into the trap. These punishments
consisted of the bastinado, the pillory, banishment, hard
labor, death. These two first are almost constantly in use:
indeed, the merchant who is bastinadoed for leading his
clerk into crime by the &#8220;decoy means,&#8221; as well as the
clerk himself, looks upon it as a &#8220;paternal correction,&#8221; and
thanks the judge for the care bestowed upon his morals.
And yet although this system was practised some three
thousand years ago, it is still followed and, of course, still
punished.</p>

<p>Even in Jewish history we have instances of this system
being pursued. See 1 Kings xiii.</p>

<p>It was also extensively practised in France during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
rebellion. Mechanics and others who followed labor for
maintenance were subjected to these &#8220;decoys,&#8221; which presented
themselves in various shapes. An old lady residing
in this city told the author that her husband found a
doubloon on his work-table, placed there by a nobleman
in whose house he was fitting up tapestry. Indignant at
the insult offered a Frenchman and a citizen, he nailed
the coin to the table, from which not without great difficulty
the tempter could remove it.</p>

<p>Is it, we ask, consistent with our form of government
and the national character of the people that this relic of
barbarism, like that of slavery, should be permitted to
exist or be practised by its chief officers?</p>

<p>Detectives only should adopt the system to aid them in
their search <i>for a criminal</i>, but an agent detective has no
right to set a decoy to test the honesty of men upon whom,
even before and after his appointment, no suspicion rested.
We again pronounce it mean and contemptible.</p>

<b>Special Agents.</b></h2>

<p class="small">&#8220;The special agents are the eyes and hands of the department to detect
and arrest violators of the law, and to render the mails a safe and rapid
means of communication. In their selection I have endeavored to secure the
qualities of integrity, sagacity, and efficiency.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Report of Postmaster-General
Montgomery Blair, June 30, 1861.</i></p>

<p>In England &#8220;special agents&#8221; are considered among the
most important adjuncts of the post-office department.
In this country they are equally important, and hold the
most responsible positions in the general arrangement and
organization of its managerial system.</p>

<p>It was under the administration of Amos Kendall,
whose devotion to the interests of the office forms one of
the most interesting features of our postal history, that
the special-agent system was introduced. As Mr. Blair
observes, in the passage quoted above, &#8220;special agents are
selected for their integrity, sagacity, and efficiency:&#8221; it
required more than mere political influence for an applicant
to obtain an appointment, simply from the fact that <i>party</i>
studies its own interest first and leaves the consequence of
its intrigues to time and opportunity. But the postal
department, aware of the sort of material which generally
makes up the political elements of party, very wisely made
the selection of special agents a matter of more serious
consideration. And yet we are fearful that even this department
will, if it has not already, become one of the
links which bind and connect it with the spirit of party
and to the chain of its political power. As far, however,
as we are able to judge of the character of those who now
fill these offices, the <i>upas power</i> of <i>party</i> has not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
exercised to any great extent in procuring their appointments.
We do not imply that from the political ranks
there cannot be found men in every respect calculated to
fulfil any office in the postal department, but we do mean
to say that in numerous cases men are selected not for
their ability to perform the duties intrusted to them, but
for a blustering, roystering reputation they had gained in
their respective wards. Every failure in our state department,
the want of energy, the lack of intelligence, the
confusion attendant on improper amusements, can invariably
be traced to these improper political appointments.</p>

<p>Special agents, apart from those qualities alluded to by
Mr. Blair, should be men of intelligence and character,
and possess an intuitive knowledge of physiognomy, phrenology,
philosophy, or the ancient Moshical, or, rather,
the Mosaical, so as to be able at a glance to read men
and become acquainted with their &#8220;inward dispositions
and with the faculties of their souls,&#8221; and be enabled to
say, with Mr. Evelyn, who studied the science, &#8220;that man
is all dissimulation.&#8221; But we contend that there are men
who, having made the subject of detection a study, not by
examining the features or watching the actions of others,
but by analytical observations, are alone capable of fulfilling
these positions.</p>

<p>The system of ferreting out losses, or, rather, its process,
is a science, and one that to succeed must be closely
studied.</p>

<p>Science is knowledge, art, power, and skill in the use of
such knowledge: if it be directed to one particular object,
exercising caution in such connection, the result will inevitably
be favorable.</p>

<p>The duties of a special agent are such that these qualifications
are essential to success. And we may say that in
the selection of men&mdash;men who now hold these positions&mdash;the
postal department has not been governed by petty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
political influence, but on the principle involved in our
popular maxim, &#8220;<i>The right man in the right place</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The duties of a special agent are, in a measure, &#8220;secrets
of the office,&#8221; and his movements are generally so quiet
that few persons in and out of the office have the least
idea what those duties are: hence the mystery in which
all his operations seem involved. Perhaps it would not
be proper, or, at least, so far as the interest of the department
is concerned, for us to explain the exact position
these special agents hold. They have a wide range of
duties, which, however, it is not necessary to particularize
and, as stated, explain, except so far as either of them may
have a bearing upon the object of this work. All losses
of valuable letters or depredations on the mails are submitted
to them for investigation. The particular means
to be used in discovering the exact locality of a theft from
the mails or in ferreting out and arresting the perpetrators,
are left entirely to their intelligence, vigilance, and
ingenuity. It is natural that a special agent should become
reserved, unobtrusive, quiet in all his actions, no
hurry or bustle, ever cautious, so that he may be enabled
to make discoveries without leading to suspicion and
alarming the guilty. Indeed, such an effect on a man&#8217;s
natural temperament would be the consequence of his
peculiar business. His means, however, depend upon his
observation: he first learns the amount of loss, the nature
of the theft, the character of the money, and the line of
postal communications between the sender and the expectant
recipient. These are his ground-works, upon which
he erects his superstructure, theoretical and practical, for
the detection of the criminal.</p>

<p>Were we to give our readers some account of these discovered
thefts, romance would lose half its charms of
enchantment, truth being more powerful and impressive
than fiction. To do this would be to betray the secrets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
the office and to stimulate the rogues to form new plans
of avoiding detection, as well as in their system of thieving.</p>

<p>These agents, as we have observed, keep themselves
aloof from the general business of the office, and not unfrequently
mystify those with whom they occasionally
come in contact. They are not the tempters of the clerks
by <i>meaningly</i> employing the decoy-letter practice, but the
silent workers of justice in pursuit of the guilty: hence
the honest employees of the office can boldly say with
Macbeth,&mdash;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>WHAT IS REQUIRED OF A SPECIAL AGENT.</i></h3>

<p>1. He should have a thorough knowledge of the laws
and regulations of the department.</p>

<p>2. Apart from his special duties, he is to report and
make known to the department any unnecessary expenditure
on the part of those who have control of the mails,
and at the same time report where there is any deficiency
of agents, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. He is intrusted with keys to the several mail-locks
in use, and is, by virtue of his commission, authorized to
open and examine the mails whenever and wherever.</p>

<p>4. He is also empowered to enter and examine any post-office
which, in his judgment, may lead to the success of
his investigations.</p>

<p>5. He should, when travelling, attract as little attention
as possible, and conceal his official character from observation
as much as possible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>6. He must make himself acquainted with mail-routes,
and their connection with the office of a special agent.</p>

<p>It is not possible for the department to instruct an
agent in the particular means to be employed in discovering
the exact locality of an ascertained robbery of the
mail, or in ferreting out and arresting the perpetrators.
These must be as various as the circumstances which surround
each case, and he must exercise his own ingenuity
and acuteness to effect his purpose.</p>

<p>We have, probably, furnished our readers with sufficient
information upon this peculiar branch of the postal department.
A writer speaking upon this subject says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the nature of their employment, special agents
are constantly brought in contact with the most intelligent
and prominent men in the community, who justly expect
to find the post-office department represented by men of
gentlemanly bearing, fair education, correct deportment,
and sound discretion. The absence of any of these qualities,
especially of all of them, would lower the standing
of the department with those whose good opinion is most
valuable, and would naturally cause speculations on the
reasons why persons so deficient in the qualities necessary
to make them acceptable to people of discernment should
have been appointed to such a responsible post.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SPECIAL AGENT OF THE LETTER-CARRIERS&#8217;
DEPARTMENT.</i></h3>

<p>Since the introduction of the free-delivery letter system
the position of a carrier has become one of considerable importance,
from the fact of his duties being not only
doubled, but the amount of responsibility considerably
increased. At first there was considerable opposition in
some places to having carriers at all; and even in large
cities postmasters opposed it, as a general thing. Mr. C.
A. Walborn, postmaster of Philadelphia, was among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
first to favor the abolishing the one-cent system, and the
making four trips a day, instead of two, as heretofore.
It is true, this added materially to the labor of a carrier,
but by lessening the routes it was soon found as practicable
as it was beneficial to the community. Perhaps no
city in the Union can boast of a better-organized system
of the carriers&#8217; department than that of Philadelphia.
Gradually, as merchants became aware of the facilities it
afforded them, and the energetic movements and attention
shown by the carriers to their interest, and of letters
being delivered free of charge, they hailed the system as
an important era in the postal department. In all large
cities and populous towns the system became general, and
four deliveries of a letter a day added materially to the
confidence it had inspired.</p>

<p>In view of the importance attached to this department,
Postmaster-General Montgomery Blair appointed Joseph
W. Briggs, Esq., of Cleveland, Ohio, &#8220;special agent&#8221; to
superintend the operations of the letter-carriers&#8217; department
throughout the United States. Mr. Briggs in every
respect was qualified for the position. His acquaintance
with postal matters, and the interest he took in the
general delivery of letters, well qualified him to undertake
the important duty. We met Mr. Briggs in the Philadelphia
post-office, September, 1865, while on his postal
tour; and it afforded us an opportunity of exchanging
opinions upon the subject of the carriers&#8217; system, in which
he expressed himself in terms of one who had studied it
with an eye to the interest both of the carriers and that
of the department.</p>

<p>Apart from his special duties in large cities, he was
authorized by the department to establish the system in
all places requiring it: hence in a short time the having
letters brought to our very doors, even in the rural districts,
will become general.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Briggs goes into the philosophy of the subject: he
calculates first the amount of labor a carrier has to perform
in the office; secondly, the amount of physical labor
required in the performance of his duty as a carrier of
letters. Thus the mental and physical are properly inquired
into, and their respective duties classified. The
result of the latter, as calculated by Mr. Briggs, is as
follows:&mdash;One hundred and twenty-eight carriers of the
Philadelphia office travel daily 2652 miles,&mdash;being an
average of over twenty-two miles per day each man.
<i>This is no sinecure!</i></p>

<p>Apart from this statement, the author of this work
called the attention of the agent to an additional item in
this calculation; and that was the travelling up several
pair of stairs, passing through long corridors and galleries
of large public and other buildings, to deliver letters to the
several occupants, would make up an additional mile or two
to the above statistic of figures. Perhaps one good result
will arise from the report which Mr. Briggs has made to
the department; and that will be to increase the number
of carriers, and add some twenty-five per cent. to their
salaries.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A LEAF FROM A SPECIAL AGENT&#8217;S NOTE-BOOK.</i></h3>

<p>In the months of April and May, 1861, a large number
of registered letters from points in the State of New
York, passing through the New York and Philadelphia
offices to Egg Harbor City and other places in that section
of New Jersey, failed to reach their destination.
Before Mr. C. A. Walborn took charge of the office at
Philadelphia, the attention of special agent Mr. S. B. Row
had been drawn to these losses by the late lamented Mr.
James Holbrook, who was the oldest special agent in the
employ of the post-office department. In June, Mr.
Row went to New York City, and had a consultation with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Mr. Holbrook; and, although they differed in opinion as
to the precise locality where the trouble probably existed,
it was determined to put through some <i>decoy-letters</i>. One
of these letters &#8220;turned up missing,&#8221; but, for reasons not
necessary to repeat here, nothing was said about it then,
but Mr. Row was perfectly satisfied that the abstraction
of letters took place in the Philadelphia post-office; and,
after an interview with one of the clerks whom he had
taken into his confidence, suspicions were directed to
Franklin M. Reed. Reed was an old post-office clerk,
who, with an intermission of perhaps twelve months, had
been in the office for twenty odd years. Efforts were frequently
made to &#8220;trap&#8221; Reed, but none of them succeeded,
until, on the evening of the 8th of August, a &#8220;decoy&#8221; was
jointly prepared by Mr. Row and Mr. William M. Ireland,
the present chief clerk (1865) of the Philadelphia
post-office.</p>

<p>This decoy had all the appearance of a regular registered
letter from New York, and was addressed to an
imaginary Mrs. Green, at Atlantic City, from her devoted
husband, who enclosed her two dollars to relieve her
present wants, and promising to visit her at the end of the
week. This letter was, at a favorable moment, slipped
into the New York package, which Reed was then about
&#8220;casing up.&#8221; Next morning Mr. Ireland examined the
Atlantic City mail, and found that the letter for the
<i>imaginary</i> Mrs. Green was missing. At 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> Mr. Reed
quit work. A short time previous, Mr. Row had seen
Mr. Ireland, who was acting under the instructions of the
former, and, on learning the condition of affairs, it was
determined to wait for Mr. Reed at the corner of Third
and Carter&#8217;s Streets, when he should make his appearance
there on leaving the office. Soon Reed came out, when
he was accosted by the special agent, who informed him
that he required about five minutes of his time in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
postmaster&#8217;s private room. On his way there, Reed drew
out his watch several times; but he was too closely watched
to admit of his dropping any thing on his way back. On
entering the room, Mr. Row told him that a certain letter
was missing, and that, as it had last been in his hands,
it became his painful duty to search him. Reed quietly
submitted; and in his watch-fob was found the money
which had been enclosed in the Green letter.</p>

<p>Reed was taken before United States Commissioner
Hazlitt, and, after a hearing, was committed to prison in
default of $3000 bail. On the 20th of August the United
States District Court convened, and the grand jury found
a true bill on the indictment. On the 27th Reed was
tried, and the jury rendered a verdict of &#8220;guilty.&#8221; Reed
was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment in the Eastern
Penitentiary of Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE YOUTHFUL MAIL-ROBBER.</i></h3>

<p>Some time in the year 1860, a man by the name of
Pardon Barrett made his appearance at Jackson Corners,
Susquehanna county, Pennsylvania. He was a shoemaker
by trade, and opened a shop for business. He had no
family, kept bachelor&#8217;s hall, and associated very little
with men, simply confining himself to business relations
with them. He, however, seemed to take pleasure in the
company of boys, and, by insinuating himself into their
good graces, soon succeeded in making his domicile a sort
of rendezvous, or place of meeting, for a select few, upon
whom he seemed to have some special design. In the
winter of 1862-63, Barrett&#8217;s shop became a sort of <i>pleasure-place</i>
for these youngsters,&mdash;pleasure to eat oyster-suppers,
play cards and dice, until he obtained an influence over
them that their parents could never have obtained either
for good or evil.</p>

<p>Were we writing an essay on juvenile depravity, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of the strongest arguments used would be that of parents
losing sight of the vacant hours of their children. Associations
formed at these times have not unfrequently laid
the foundation of their ruin. This will be illustrated as
we proceed.</p>

<p>Among the lads who visited Barrett was Henry W.
Fletcher, a bright, intelligent boy of thirteen years: he
was the son of the village postmaster. Barrett seemed to
have a more than ordinary fondness for this boy,&mdash;associated
and talked with him wherever and whenever he met him.
It was for the purpose of cementing this friendship still
closer, and strengthening the influence he was gradually
obtaining over him, that the oyster-suppers and card-playing
were inaugurated. No one would have taken
such pains with young Fletcher, mastering his timidity,
establishing a friendship, and ministering to his youthful
pleasures, if he had not something in view,&mdash;some purpose,
some object. Those who have read Oliver Twist
cannot have forgotten the character of &#8220;Old Fagin,&#8221; and
how he gathered around him a number of boys and taught
them the art and mystery of stealing. Barrett, no doubt,
had read Oliver Twist, and, as we shall see, imitated his
plan and followed his example in preparing boys for the
gallows.</p>

<p>On the occasion of one of the oyster-parties, Barrett
suggested to young Fletcher that, as our soldiers were
sending money home, he might, if he were sharp, get
some of it. Fletcher started: he could not at first comprehend
how, <i>honestly</i>, he could hold the soldiers&#8217; money.
&#8220;Easy enough,&#8221; remarked Barrett; &#8220;by taking the letters
out of the post-office.&#8221; An associate of Barrett&#8217;s, and
perhaps the only one he had, was present. For reasons
not necessary to give here, we conceal his name. This
man urged the boy also to commit this serious offence of
robbing the post-office, but stated, as if he possessed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
power, &#8220;that he would see him out of the scrape if he was
detected.&#8221; The imagination of the boy was excited by
the programme laid out by these villains,&mdash;how they would
take him with them to Buffalo, then across the lake into
Canada, &#8220;where,&#8221; as Barrett remarked, &#8220;nobody could
find them.&#8221; Then they would proceed to the Western
States, seek a wild, retired place in the forest, build a
hut, and pass their time in hunting, fishing, and other
wild-wood sports. To a lad naturally sprightly, romantic,
and possessing more than ordinary intelligence, such a
prospect was quite fascinating. All arch-villains, whenever
they want tools to work with, invariably excite the
imagination, which oversteps the bounds of discretion, and
carries the victim on to his ruin. When Aaron Burr
planned his great scheme of revolutionizing the South,
and, no doubt, with an eye to the subjugation of the North,
he selected out a wild enthusiast, one Herman Blennerhassett,
for a sort of leader. Blennerhassett was an adventurer,
romantic and chivalric: he lived on an island of
the Ohio River, still retaining his name. Here he built
a splendid mansion, and possessing, it is said, great wealth,
he expended vast sums of money in decorating both the
mansion and the island. The ruins of the former are still
to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Like the man Barrett, Aaron Burr and
Blennerhassett enticed to their island a number of young
men, whose imaginations became excited by the descriptive
scenes given them by these arch-traitors of Mexico and
the South,&mdash;gardens of beauty and Golconda&#8217;s of wealth.
High commissions were promised them; but the bubble
burst, their plans were detected, the parties arrested and
tried for high treason.</p>

<p>Barrett pictured to young Fletcher the wild sports of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
the far West, and how they would enjoy themselves when
once settled in some vast wilderness. Three months, however,
elapsed before young Fletcher consented, and it was
in the early part of May, while his father, the postmaster,
was absent at New York, that he commenced operations.
The first step he made in his career of crime yielded
twenty dollars. When this was shown to Barrett, he remarked,
with a friendly smile, &#8220;Good! you have made a
fine beginning; keep it going, and the wild-wood sports
will soon be our pastime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher, now that his hand was in, did keep it going,
and in three weeks the fund was increased to two hundred
and twenty-five dollars. Barrett had given him certain
instructions, which he strictly followed: these were, not
to take more than one package of letters at a time, and
then only such as were passing through the office; nor
was he to take any belonging to the Jackson office; also,
he was to take no letters unless they had Washington
City post-mark on them. The understanding between
them was that Fletcher was to retain all the money until
their final departure; then it was to be divided among
them, or a treasurer appointed until they reached their
wild-wood destination. Fletcher kept the money hid
away, as Barrett told him it was dangerous to carry it
about him. On several occasions, however, he tried to
get money out of Fletcher, but the latter invariably refused
to advance a cent, holding the former to the bond,
which was not to use any of the money until their general
meeting previous to their departure West. It seems, however,
that about this time the losses were being looked
to by the post-office department, and, for reasons which
are foreign to the matter in hand, young Fletcher exhibited
a more liberal spirit to a boy named Brownson
than he did to Barrett, by furnishing him with forty
dollars to enable him to run away from home. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
not a very difficult matter on the part of the department
to trace the robbery as soon as the money from letters was
missing. Once on the <i>railroad</i> of suspicion, the detective
soon reached the <i>depot</i>,&mdash;the scene of theft.</p>

<p>The boy Fletcher was at first supposed to be the only
person concerned in the affair; but the investigation developed
the facts above stated, and Barrett, who had suddenly
left for New York, was arrested at Genesee on the
9th of June. On the 16th he was taken to Williamsport,
Pennsylvania, where the United States District Court was
held; on the 17th he was put on trial; on the 18th found
guilty; and on the 20th he was lodged in the Western
Penitentiary at Alleghany City, Pennsylvania, the court
having sentenced him to three years&#8217; imprisonment. Barrett&#8217;s
age was fifty-six, which influenced the court in
shortening the term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The principal witness against Barrett was young Fletcher.
A large number of letters was found at a place designated
by him. One hundred and sixty dollars and other mailable
matter were found where he said they were concealed.
The most important item of testimony, however, was that
which related to a silver half-dollar, which Fletcher alleged
he had taken out of a letter, and which he had sold
to Barrett for sixty cents in currency. It was ascertained
that a drafted man, on leaving for the army, had taken
inadvertently with him a half-dollar belonging to his little
son. At the time the tampering was going on with letters
at the post-office, he had enclosed a half-dollar in a letter
to his wife to replace the one he had taken away with him.
This letter had to pass through the Jackson office, but it
never reached its destination. Doubtless this was the one
out of which Fletcher got the half-dollar sold to Barrett.
It is a curious fact in the history of criminals that their
detection, in nine cases out of ten, is caused by some very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
trifling incident connected with the operations. So it was
in this case.</p>

<p>The 126th section of the act of Congress of March 3,
1825, makes the opening, embezzling, or destroying of
mail-letters or packages containing articles of value an
offence punishable with imprisonment not less than two,
nor more than ten, years. The 129th section of the same
act provides &#8220;That every person who, from and after the
passage of this act, shall procure and advise, or assist, in
the doing or perpetration of any of the acts or crimes by
this act forbidden, shall be subject to the same penalties
and punishments as the persons are subject to who shall
actually do or perpetrate any of the said acts or crimes,
according to the provisions of this act.&#8221; It was under
this clause Barrett was convicted, and it is, perhaps, the
only case of the kind on record.</p>

<p>This interesting case&mdash;and were all the details given it
would prove highly so&mdash;came under the official management
of S. B. Row, Esq., special agent of the post-office
department for the State of Pennsylvania. The moment
the first intimation was received of the mails being tampered
with, he fixed upon his starting-point, and, with a
sure eye to the end, he pursued his course until he arrived
at Jackson, and by a little stratagem the whole plot was
discovered. He traced it from the first step young Fletcher
made into crime, after receiving his lesson from Barrett,
up to the loss of the silver half-dollar. The case, if fairly
written out, with all the details, would make an invaluable
paper for some Sunday-school tract-publishing institution.
It is, indeed, a lesson for youth.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE DISHONEST MERCHANT.</i></h3>

<p>Crime in high places has of late become fashionable;
law itself has become aristocratic, and maintains its character
for partiality by shielding aristocratical rascals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
beneath its wings. Justice is no longer blind,&mdash;at least,
one of its eyes is open,&mdash;and the distinguishing marks on a
greenback, denoting its value, are readily discerned by the
goddess. The poor wretch who steals a loaf of bread to
save his children from starvation invariably gets on the
blind side of Justice, and, of course, the sense of hearing,
and not of seeing, is exercised in his case. Bacon, in his
Essay of Judicature, says, &#8220;The place of justice is an hallowed
place, and, therefore, not only the bench, but the
foot-pace, and precincts, and purprise thereof, ought to be
preserved without scandal and corruption.&#8221; The fate of
the bread-snatcher is an evidence that the precincts of
justice and the foot-pace to its throne must be paved with
gold, or his chance, or that of any other poor man, from
escape is totally impossible. The man who steals a loaf
of bread commits a crime: he should be punished: so
should the man who swindles the government, robs the
widow, commits forgery, nay, even murder, but whose
wealth paves the way for his acquittal. (<i>See records of
our courts.</i>)</p>

<p>In the following case it will be observed that the postal
department, having some knowledge of the manner business
is conducted in our courts, took the matter into its
own hand, the chief clerk acting as <i>detective, judge, and
jury</i>, and who settled the case in a manner, without
loss of time or money, highly satisfactory to all, save the
guilty party, who, shortly after the scene we are about to
describe, was compelled to quit the city and left for parts
unknown.</p>

<p>The gentleman(?) who is the hero of the narrative&mdash;for
he was recognized as a gentleman in society&mdash;had been
in the frequent receipt, by mail, of remittances in large and
small sums. Not long since he made his appearance at
the desk of the chief clerk in the post-office, and alleged
that he had just taken from his box a letter from which a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
draft on a city bank for about one hundred dollars had
been fraudulently abstracted, and, as the point from which
the letter had been mailed was but a short distance from
Philadelphia, he was confident that the draft had been
abstracted by some one in the post-office here. This imputation
on the character of the office nettled the chief
clerk, and that functionary determined to sift the matter
to the bottom and ferret out the criminal, if such there
was. He made the necessary inquiries as to the day the
letter was due here, closely cross-examined the clerks, and,
after a diligent investigation, proceeded to the bank on
which the draft was drawn. He found that <i>it had been
paid</i>, and bore the indorsement, or seeming indorsement,
of the loser. He borrowed the draft and brought it to
the office. On comparing the apparently-forged signature
of the loser on the back of the document with the handwriting
of a certain night-clerk, a remarkable resemblance
was discovered. Several experts were called in, and declared
that the handwriting of the clerk and the chirography
of the &#8220;forger&#8221; were one and the same. A clerk in
the bank was privately shown the suspected clerk, and he
identified him as the man <i>to whom the money had been
paid</i>! The network seemed to be closing around the poor
night-clerk, and it was determined that he should be arrested.
The chief clerk, jubilant at his discovery, sent
for the merchant who said he had lost the draft. While
the chief clerk and the merchant were closeted in the postmaster&#8217;s
private office, and the former was detailing his
success to the merchant, he observed, as he proceeded with
the recital, that the merchant began to wear a livid hue;
his countenance assumed a pallid aspect, in which a guilty
conscience seemed to come to the surface to horrify and
disgust the beholder. Trembling lips, too, were seen, and,
as the truth in all its damning meanness flashed across the
mind of the chief clerk, he at once boldly charged the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
merchant with having written his own signature <i>in a
feigned hand</i>, so as to secure the spoils of his own guilt
and ruin an innocent man. The guilty, miserable creature,
overwhelmed with confusion, confessed his guilt and implored
mercy. He acknowledged his criminality in the
whole transaction,&mdash;a transaction which was about to stain
forever the reputation of an honest, hard-working man,
whose only capital was his skill as a scrivener and his
integrity in his clerical position. The chief clerk, determined
that the reputation of the night-clerk should be
vindicated, threatened to have the guilty merchant exposed
and punished unless he proceeded to a magistrate at once
and made an affidavit confessing the crime in all its
details. The merchant humiliated himself by signing and
swearing to the odious confession, and the matter there
rested.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LETTERS ADDRESSED TO CITIES ONLY.</i></h3>

<p>Many persons are in the habit of addressing letters and
circulars for firms and individuals, simply, &#8220;Philadelphia,&#8221;
&#8220;New York,&#8221; &amp;c. This practice not unfrequently
occasions delay in such letters reaching their rightful
owners. In all cases, however well the firm may be
known, it is most essential, to insure their correct delivery,
that the street or locality in which they reside, and the
number of the house, should form a portion of the address.
Many of these circulars are prepared with great care and
considerable expense: yet they are so carelessly directed that
not more than one-half of them ever reach their place of
destination, simply because that place is not designated.</p>

<p>There is another matter to which we would call the
attention of merchants and others, and that is, to be very
careful in putting postal currency on their letters, and not
revenue-stamps.</p>

<p>This carelessness on the part of those forwarding letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
has led to much loss and inconvenience, and if persisted
in they cannot blame the department, which has from
time to time called public attention to the fact. Some
put on their letters revenue-stamps, others no stamp at
all; and in many instances letters of importance have
thus lain in the office until the parties have received
through the dead-letter office information of their whereabouts.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>UNMAILABLE LETTERS.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Letters attempted to be sent with stamps previously
used or stamps cut from stamped envelopes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unpaid letters for foreign countries, on which prepayment
is required by the regulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letters not addressed, or so badly addressed that their
destination cannot be known.</p>

<p>&#8220;Letters misdirected to places where there are no post-offices.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will be here seen that the government is not responsible
for the ignorance and stupidity of all epistolarians.</p>

<p>In some instances, however, postmasters are to blame in
not paying more attention to the mode of stamping letters.</p>

<p>The examination of dead-letters discloses much carelessness
on the part of postmasters in post-marking letters,
and also in cancelling postage-stamps.</p>

<p>The latter clause of the regulations of 1859, section
397, is repealed, and the use of the office-rating or post-marking
stamp as a cancelling instrument is positively
prohibited, inasmuch as the post-mark, when impressed
on the postage-stamp, is usually indistinct, and the cancellation
effected thereby is imperfect. The postage-stamp
must, therefore, be effectually cancelled with a separate
instrument.</p>

<p>Special attention is directed to the duty imposed upon
postmasters by Regulation 396, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the cancelling has been omitted on the mailing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
of the letter, packet, or parcel, or if the cancellation be
incomplete, the postmaster at the office of delivery will
cancel the stamp in the manner directed, and forthwith
report the delinquent postmaster to the postmaster-general,
as the law requires.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ADDRESSES SHOULD BE LEGIBLE AND COMPLETE.</i></h3>

<p>We have under other heads alluded to the carelessness
of persons in addressing their letters. To make them
legible and complete, give the name of the post-town, and
if there be more than one town of that name, or if the
post-town is not well known, be careful in giving the name
of the county, which in all cases is as essential as that of
the State. The number of the house, too, if in a street,
is a great assistance. It must not be supposed that because
a letter will eventually reach its destination without
a number, the omission is not a cause of hesitation and
delay in the process of sorting for delivery; and when
such small delays occur again and again, they tend greatly
to retard the general distribution. In the case of letters
for places abroad, the name of the <i>country</i>, as well as the
town or city, should be given in full. Attention to this
latter precaution will often assist in deciphering the name
of the town or city, and will prevent the letter from being
mis-sent when there are towns of the same name in different
countries.</p>

<p>The following is an expressive lesson:&mdash;</p>

<p>A gentleman posted a letter containing drafts, checks, &amp;c.,
to a well-known New York house. Its failure to arrive
at the proper destination, of course, created great anxiety,
and all the ordinary and some extraordinary means were
employed to head off any attempt by the &#8220;mail-robber&#8221;
to negotiate the &#8220;stolen&#8221; remittances. Journeys were
made to and fro between the mailing point and the Empire
City, the newspapers were liberally patronized with notices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
of &#8220;stolen from the mail,&#8221; circulars descriptive of the lost
enclosure abounded,&mdash;all at an aggregate expense, according
to confession, of over one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>During this short season of precaution and excitement,
the letter in question had been making the official acquaintance
of the worthy postmaster of New Haven, Connecticut,
and that of his clerks, then, under the rule,
skipping off to shake hands with our friends of the dead-letter
office, and from thence finding its way back to the
writer, who says he &#8220;never before did such a stupid thing
as to write New Haven, Ct., instead of New York, N.Y.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A LAW TO BE REPEALED.</i></h3>

<p>It is only necessary to give this section of the postal
law to show its inconsistency and the necessity of its repeal
(Section 131, Printed Regulations, 1859):&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bon&acirc; fide</i> subscribers to weekly newspapers can receive
the same free of postage, if they reside in the county
in which the paper is printed and published, even if the
office to which the paper is sent is without the county,
provided it is the office at which they regularly receive
their mail-matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>In justice, however, to many publishers, who look upon
the law as too <i>liberal</i>, they disdain taking advantage of it.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>The question of the right to send and receive letters
and packets through the mail free of postage is not denied,
for it is so expressly stated in the &#8220;Laws and Regulations
of the Post-Office Department,&#8221; chap. xviii. sect. 228. It
is viewed in the light of &#8220;personal privileges,&#8221; or as an
official trust for the maintenance of official correspondence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
In both its forms the right varies in respect to different
classes of officers and individuals, in the kind as well as
weight of matters which may be so sent or received. An
interchange between publishers of pamphlets, periodicals,
magazines, and newspapers of their respective publications
is allowed for the purpose of promoting the dissemination
of this kind of information, of which they are the vehicles.
This is the head and front of the franking privilege,
nothing more, but should be considerably less.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many other channels of knowledge, and of
very important knowledge, too, which are not privileged.
Newspapers are daily or weekly letters, written to a number
of persons at once. They may be good or bad, sound
or vicious, as any other letters; and the intensity of their
action is increased by the multiplying process of printing.
This action may be good or bad: if, therefore, the
community is believed to stand in want of newspapers, as
we certainly believe it does in a very great variety of
ways, it is already going very far to grant them the privilege
of a greatly-reduced rate of postage [1841].&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Since the above was written, these rates have been reduced
to almost a nominal value. Indeed, we cannot see
any reasonable objection to be made for such exchange,
both as regards the franking privilege and the postage on
exchange-newspapers. Patriotism on the part of those
claiming the right of the first would induce them to
forego it, while those who enjoy the latter should remember
that, as they derive profit from their labor, the
government should not be the sufferer in consequence.
Upon this subject we consider the following article from
the very able report of Postmaster Joseph Holt in 1859
as containing the best and the most forcible arguments
that can be used to correct what we consider more in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
light of an error than that of an abuse. The press of our
country is too enlightened to persist in claiming a privilege
that militates against the financial interest of the
government; and we feel assured that, if the subject is
properly brought before them, they will readily conform
to any law that may be established to correct the error or
do away with an abuse.</p>

<p class="center">(From the Report of the Postmaster-General.)</p>

<p class="name">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Post-Office Department, 1859.</span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;The act of 1825 authorized &#8216;every printer of newspapers
to send one paper to each and every other printer
of newspapers within the United States free of postage,&#8217;
and such is the existing law. However slight the support
which this statute may seem to give to publishers, it imposes
in the aggregate a heavy and unjust burden on the
department. The advantage thus conferred inures to the
benefit alike of the publisher who sends and of him who
receives the paper in exchange. I have in vain sought
for any satisfactory explanation of the policy indicated by
this provision. It seems far more exceptionable than the
franking privilege, since the latter professes to be exercised
on behalf of the public, whereas the exemption secured
by the former is enjoyed wholly in advancement of a
private and personal interest. The newspapers received
in exchange by the journalist are, in the parlance of commerce,
his stock in trade. From their columns he gathers
materials for his own, and thus makes the same business
use of them that the merchant does of his goods, or the
mechanic of the raw material which he proposes to manufacture
into fabrics. But as the government transports
nothing free of charge to the farmer, the merchant, or the
mechanic, to enable them to prosecute successfully and
economically their respective pursuits, why shall it do so
for the journalist? If the latter can rightfully claim that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
his newspapers shall be thus delivered to him at the
public expense, why may he not also claim that his
stationery and his type, and indeed every thing which
enters into the preparation of the sheets he issues as his
means of living, be delivered to him on the same terms?
It has been urged, I am aware, that postage on newspaper
exchanges would be a tax on the dissemination of knowledge;
but so is the postage which the farmer, merchant,
and mechanic pay on the newspapers for which they subscribe,
a tax on the dissemination of knowledge, and yet
it is paid by them uncomplainingly. If it be insisted
that the publishers of newspapers, as a class, are in such
a condition as to entitle them to demand the aid of the
public funds, it may be safely answered that such an
assumption is wholly unwarranted. Journalism in the
United States rests upon the broadest and deepest foundations,
and is running a career far more brilliant and prosperous
than in any other nation of the world. The exceedingly
reduced rates at which its issues pass through
the mails secure to it advantages enjoyed under no other
government. Under the fostering care of the free spirit
of the age, it has now become an institution in itself in
this country, and controls the tides of the restless ocean
of public opinion with almost resistless sway. It is the
<i>avant-courier</i> of the genius of our institutions, and is
everywhere the advocate of progress and of the highest
and noblest forms of human freedom. Is it not, therefore,
to the last degree unseemly, if not worse, that in its
own enterprises, and in furtherance of its own pecuniary
interests, it should claim permission to violate habitually
a great principle of which it is the constant advocate, and
which underlies our whole political system,&mdash;the principle
of equal rights to all and special privileges to none? If,
however, from the grandeur and beneficence of its mission,
the press is to be excepted from the operation of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
wholesome democratic doctrine, and is to be subsidized to
the extent of its postages by the government, then undeniably
such subsidy should be contributed from the common
treasury, instead of being imposed, as at present,
on the oppressed revenues of the post-office department,
which, under all circumstances, should be maintained inviolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the same category, but for more cogent reasons,
must fall that class of weekly newspapers which the statute
of 1852 requires shall be delivered free of postage to all
subscribers residing within the limits of the county in
which they are published. This requisition is less sound
on the score of principle than even the discrimination in
favor of the press. There may be something in the characteristics
of the latter&mdash;ennobled as it is as the organ
of the intellect and heart of millions of freemen&mdash;which
might induce many to grant to it special and distinguishing
immunities; but why a citizen who chances to reside
on one side of a county line shall be exempted from a
postage on his newspaper, which his neighbor on the other
side of that line is obliged to pay on the same paper, surpasses
my comprehension.&#8221;</p>

<p>Connected with this letter is the following incident: it
fortunately came to Philadelphia, and, of course, from its
superscription was placed apart to find its way to the
dead-letter-office. One day a poor Irishwoman came to
the window and asked for a letter from her son, giving
no name. The simplicity of the question struck the clerk,
and the letter addressed &#8220;To My Mother&#8221; flashed upon
his mind. He turned to the case and selected the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does your son reside? what part of Ireland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belfast, sir.&#8221; Belfast was the post-mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patrick McLaughlan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open that letter,&#8221; handing her the one in question.
She did so, and, casting her eyes on the signature, exclaimed,
&#8220;From my son! from my boy!&#8221; Sure enough,
there was the name,&mdash;Patrick McLaughlan.</p>

<p>The clerk gave her some instructions for future correspondence
which probably proved of advantage to her.</p>

<p>Somebody sent a newspaper through the mails the other
day directed as follows: &#8220;To Honest Father Abraham,
God bless him, Washington, D. C.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is a literal copy of the superscription of
a registered letter received from Ireland, written, strange
as it may seem, in a &#8220;clerkly hand&#8221;:</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>The money-order system, which in England is so popular,
has partly failed here. It went into operation on the
1st of November, 1864, under circumstances which promised
a decided success. The amount to which the law
limited the order-system was not less than one dollar, and
not more than thirty dollars. This was to accommodate a
certain class of people, and at the same time test the utility
of the system for the purpose of hereafter creating a more
extensive operation of the principle and also increasing the
amount of money sent.</p>

<p>That it is an important step in postal progress its operation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
in Europe is sufficient proof; but here we started
wrong. What should have been a plain, simple transaction
between the parties&mdash;the paying money and receiving
an order&mdash;has become perfectly mystified by the ambiguity
of the language of the law, as well as the numerous technicalities
thrown around it. A poor woman applies to the
window for a postal order on New York for ten dollars:
she expects the order made payable to herself or to the
party to whom she sends it, which on presentation would be
immediately paid. It will be observed, upon reading the
&#8220;General Principles of the Money-Order System&#8221; and the
&#8220;Instructions to Postmasters at Money-Order Offices,&#8221;
that if this poor woman was requested to read the &#8220;laws
and regulations&#8221; it would be to her &#8220;all Greek.&#8221; Were
the amounts named thousands of dollars instead of pennies,
those interested would be of a class whose education
and business knowledge would enable them to comprehend
it: as it is, we know several instances of poor persons
resorting to the old custom of forwarding their money
rather than undergo the ordeal of a clerk&#8217;s explanation of
the law.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>I. Money-order offices are divided into two classes.
Offices of the first class are depositories, in which those of
the second class deposit their surplus money-order funds.</p>

<p>II. Any office in either class may draw upon any other
office in the list of money-order offices for a sum, upon
one order, from <i>one dollar</i> to <i>thirty dollars</i>. But when a
larger sum than the latter is required, additional orders to
make it up must be obtained.</p>

<p>III. When money-orders exceeding one hundred and
fifty dollars in aggregate amount are issued in one day,
and to the same person, by one or more offices, upon a
second-class office, the postmaster at the office so drawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
upon will be permitted to delay the payment of such orders
for five days.</p>

<p>IV. The money-orders shall be made out upon printed
forms supplied by the post-office department, and no order
will be valid or payable unless given upon one of such
forms.</p>

<p>V. Any person applying for a money-order will be
required to state the particulars upon a form of application
which will be furnished to him for that purpose by the
postmaster.</p>

<p>VI. If the purchaser of a money-order, from having
made an error in stating the name of the office of payment,
or for other reasons, desires to have the said money-order
changed, the issuing postmaster will take back the first
order and issue another in lieu thereof, for which an additional
fee shall be charged and exacted as for a new transaction.
The order so taken back must be cancelled by the
postmaster and entered in his books and returns, in its
proper numerical order, as &#8220;cancelled.&#8221;</p>

<p>VII. Parties procuring money-orders should examine
them carefully, to see that they are properly filled up and
stamped. This caution will appear the more necessary
when it is understood that any defect in this respect will
throw difficulties in the way of payment.</p>

<p>VIII. When a money-order is presented for payment
at the office upon which it is drawn, the postmaster or
authorized clerk will use all proper means to assure himself
that the applicant is the person named and intended
in the advice; and upon payment of the order care must
be taken to obtain the signature of the payee (or of the
person authorized by him to receive payment) to the receipt
on the face of the order.</p>

<p>IX. When, for any reason, the payee of a money-order does
not desire, or is unable, to present the same in person, he is
legally empowered, by his written indorsement thereon, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
direct payment to be made to any other person; and it is
the duty of the postmaster upon whom the order is drawn
to pay the amount thereof to the person thus designated;
provided the postmaster is satisfied that such indorsement
is genuine, and that the second party shall give correct
information as to the name and address of the person who
originally obtained the order. <span class="smcap">More than one indorsement
is prohibited by law, and will render an
order invalid and not payable.</span></p>

<p>X. Any money-order office may repay an order issued
by itself if repayment is applied for on the day of such
issue, but then only to the person who obtained it, except
in special cases. The fee or charge shall not in any case
be refunded. If, however, repayment of an order is desired
later than one day after its issue, the postmaster must
refer the application to the money-order office of the post-office
department.</p>

<p>XI. The fees or charges for money-orders will be as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>For an order of $1 or more, but not exceeding $10,
10 cents.</p>

<p>For an order of $10 or more, but not exceeding $20,
15 cents.</p>

<p>For an order of $20 or more, but not exceeding $30,
20 cents.</p>

<p>Fractions of cents must not be introduced into any
order.</p>

<p>XII. When a money-order has been lost by either remitter
or payee, a duplicate thereof will be issued to the
party losing the original, provided he shall furnish a
statement, under oath or affirmation, setting forth the
loss or destruction thereof, and a certificate from the postmaster
by whom it was payable, that the said order had
not been paid, and would not thereafter be paid if presented.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
A second fee will be charged and exacted for the
issue of duplicate orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Instructions to Postmasters at Money-Order
Offices&#8221; take up too much space for our book: indeed, we omit
even a synopsis of them, as we feel perfectly satisfied that
our readers would have to study law before they could fully
comprehend their mysteries. We call the attention, however,
of the public to the following rules to be observed
as a cautionary measure:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1. To take all means to prevent the loss of a money-order.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. Never to send the order in the same letter with the
information required on payment thereof.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. To be careful, on taking out a money-order, to state
correctly the Christian name, as well as the surname, of
the person in whose favor it is to be drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. To see that the name and address of the person
taking out the money-order are correctly made known to
the person in whose favor it is to be drawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neglect of these instructions will risk the loss of the
money, besides leading to delay and trouble in obtaining
payment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under no circumstances can payment of an order be
demanded on the day of its issue.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the money is not called for within ninety days after
the date of the order, there will be difficulty in obtaining
it. The regular form of the order must not be clipped or
mutilated. When the payee of an order desires the same
to be paid to any other person, he must fill up and sign
a form of indorsement, and furnish such second party
with the information required to obtain payment of his
order, who upon receiving payment must sign his name
upon the face of the order. More than one indorsement
is prohibited by law, and will render the order invalid
and not payable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the system had not been laid
down so as to come within the comprehension of all, and
so simplified that the explanations from the clerks would
not tend to involve it in a greater mystery. It reminds
us strongly of a passage in Haddock&#8217;s Chancery Practice,
vol. 1, p. 125, intended as a definition of law:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;When a person is bound <i>to do</i> a thing, and he <i>does</i>
what may enable him <i>to do</i> the thing, he is supposed in
equity <i>to do</i> it with the view of <i>doing</i> what he is bound
<i>to do</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.</i></h3>

<p>The freedom of the press, as understood and secured
by high constitutional authority, consists in its identification
with every principle which is involved in our Declaration
of Independence. It dare not aim its shafts at the
existence of the government, the Constitution, and the
Union. And yet has not the press&mdash;a portion of it, we
mean&mdash;aimed to do so during this rebellion, and that, too,
at a time while claiming that government&#8217;s protection?
A press devoted to the cause of traitors is as much a traitor
to the government as are those who are arrayed in arms
for its destruction. It ceases to be considered the palladium
of liberty, and assumes at once the character of a
rebel and a spy, the moment it strikes at the root of the
tree whose fruit is freedom!</p>

<p>Our government, unfortunately, at the outbreak of the
rebellion did not claim the power to suppress such treasonable
publications, but actually left them free to publish
what they pleased. The consequence <i>was</i>, and <i>is</i>, that
that portion of the press is as hostile to the administration
now as it was in the beginning, <i>silence giving them consent
to commit crime</i>. Nor was this all: our very postal department
assisted in disseminating their papers by allowing
them to go and come with impunity. Thus the mails<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
established by the United States Government were and,
we are afraid, are still used for its own destruction. Is
there any principle of law or of justice to sanction such
leniency on our part?</p>

<p>Judge Story, of the Supreme Court, on one occasion,
commenting on that clause of the Constitution securing
the freedom of the press, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That this amendment was intended to secure to every
citizen an absolute right to speak or write or print whatsoever
he might please, without any responsibility, public
or private, therefor, is a supposition too wild to be indulged
in by any rational man. This would be to allow
to every citizen the right to destroy at his pleasure the
reputation, the peace, the property, and even the personal
safety of every other citizen. A man might, out of mere
malice or revenge, accuse another of the most infamous
crimes, might excite against him the indignation of all
his fellow-citizens by the most atrocious calumnies, might
disturb, nay, overturn all his domestic peace, and embitter
his parental affections, might inflict the most distressing
punishments upon the weak, the timid, and the innocent,
might prejudice all a man&#8217;s civil and political and private
rights, and might stir up sedition, rebellion, and treason,
even against the government itself, in the wantonness
of his passions or the corruption of his heart. Civil
society could not go on under such circumstances. Men
would then be obliged to resort to private vengeance to
make up the deficiency of the law; and assassinations and
savage cruelties would be perpetrated with all the frequency
belonging to barbarous and cruel communities.
It is plain, then, that the language of this amendment
imports no more than that every man has a right to speak,
write, and print his opinions upon any subject whatever,
without any prior restraint, so always that he does not
injure any other person in his rights, person, property, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
reputation, <i>and so always that he does not thereby disturb
the public peace or attempt to subvert the government</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>POST-OFFICE CURIOSITIES.</i></h3>

<p>There are many curious things daily occurring in the
post-office under this head. In &#8220;Chambers&#8217;s Journal&#8221;
we find the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A formal but most essential rule makes letters once
posted the property of the postmaster-general until they
are delivered as addressed, and they must not be given up
to the <i>writers</i> on any pretence whatever. One or two requests
of this kind related to us we are not likely soon to
forget. On one occasion a commercial traveller called at
an office and expressed a fear that he had enclosed two
letters in wrong envelopes, the addresses of which he furnished.
It appeared from the account which he reluctantly
gave, after a refusal to grant his request, that his position
and prospects depended upon his getting his letters and
correcting the mistakes, inasmuch as they revealed plans
which he had adopted to serve two mercantile houses in
the same line of business, whose interests clashed at every
point. Another case occurred in which a fast young gentleman
confessed to carrying on a confidential correspondence
with two young ladies at the same time, and that he
had, or feared he had, crossed two letters which he had
written at the same sitting. Writing of this, we are
reminded of a case in which a country postmaster had
a letter put into his hand through the office-window, together
with the following message, delivered with great
emphasis:&mdash;&#8216;Here&#8217;s a letter; she wants it to go along as
fast as it can, &#8216;cause there&#8217;s a feller wants to have her here,
and she&#8217;s courted by another feller that&#8217;s not here, and she
wants to know whether he&#8217;s going to have her or not.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fatal Letter.</span>&mdash;A tradesman&#8217;s daughter, who
had been for some time engaged to a prosperous young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
draper in a neighboring town, heard, from one whom she
and her parents considered a creditable authority, that he
was on the verge of bankruptcy. Not a day was to be
lost in breaking the bond by which she and her small fortune
were linked to penury. A letter, strong and conclusive
in its language, was at once written and posted, when
the same informant called upon the young lady&#8217;s friends
to contradict and explain his former statement, which had
arisen out of some misunderstanding. They rushed at
once to the post-office; and no words can describe the
scene,&mdash;the reiterated appeals, the tears, the wringing of
hands, the united entreaties of father, mother, and daughter,
for the restoration of the fatal letter. But the rule admitted
of no exception, and the young lady had to repent
at leisure of her inordinate haste.</p>

<p>In this country we are not so strict, as any person posting
a letter can have it restored to him by simply signing
his name to the fact of its being by him written. We
would, however, suggest to the department the propriety
of establishing the English system; for we feel confident
that the moment rogues turn their attention to the post-office
for the purpose of plunder, taking advantage of this
loose way of doing business will be the consequence.
Another thing: it will make men more careful, and thus
save the department an immense deal of trouble.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>NEWSPAPERS.</i></h3>

<p>Although we have strict laws upon the subject of <i>trifling</i>
with newspapers, our postmasters do not enforce them to
the extent they should. The following is a provision of
the English law which does not remain, as with us, a
&#8220;dead letter:&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newspapers are always to be considered of equal importance
with letters; and postmasters are forbidden to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
open them for any other purpose than that required by
law, and are also forbidden to lend them to any person.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center f8">(From the &#8220;English Postal.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">By Weight.</span>&mdash;If the weight be exceeded to the smallest
extent, even though the balance be merely turned, the
book or printed paper becomes liable to a higher postage.
To provide, therefore, for errors in scales, &amp;c., it is well
to allow a little margin, or to pay the postage of the next
greater weight. It should be remembered that a newspaper
when wet weighs more than when dry. Forgetfulness
on this point sometimes causes groundless complaints
about charges for newspapers,&mdash;the complainant erroneously
supposing, on weighing the newspaper on its arrival, and
when it had had time to dry, that he had been overcharged.
The foregoing observations apply also to books, &amp;c. sent
abroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Information.</span>&mdash;No information can be given respecting
letters which pass through a post-office, except to the
persons to whom they are addressed; and in no other
way is official information of a private character allowed
to be made public.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Return Letters.</span>&mdash;Postmasters are not allowed to
return any letter to the writer, or sender, or to any one
else, or to delay forwarding it to its destination according
to the address, even though a request to such effect be
written thereon; as every letter must be delivered to the
person to whom it is directed (and to him alone) at the
address it bears.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Forbidden Articles.</span>&mdash;The rule which forbids the
transmission through the post of any article likely to injure
the contents of the mail-bags or the person of any
officer of the post-office is, of course, applicable to the
pattern-post; and a packet containing any thing of the
kind will be stopped and not sent to its destination.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Articles such as the following have been occasionally
posted as patterns, and have been detained as unfit for the
post, viz.,&mdash;metal boxes, porcelain and china, fruit, vegetables,
bunches of flowers, cuttings of plants, spurs, knives,
scissors, needles, pins, pieces of machinery, watch-machinery,
sharp-pointed instruments, samples of metals,
samples of ore, samples in glass bottles, pieces of glass,
acids of various kinds, curry-combs, copper and steel engraving-plates,
and confectionery of various kinds.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>WATCH YOUR LETTER-BOXES.</i></h3>

<p>In many of our large post-offices postmasters have
baskets placed inside for the reception of letters. These
are invariably too small, and it not unfrequently occurs
that the aperture through which letters pass gets choked
up, the basket being full to its mouth. Any person could
from the outside take a handful of letters without any one
being aware of it. Honest men, however, making the
discovery, notify the clerks of the situation of the letters,
but not until it is very natural to suppose some letters
may have been stolen. This will account in some measure
for the mysterious disappearance of letters which have
caused many an innocent person to be suspected and the
business operations of an office justly censured. These
baskets, instead of being wide and shallow, are deep and
narrow. If properly constructed and arranged, there would
be no necessity for clerks shouting out, &#8220;Swamp on the
baskets.&#8221; This is very much like locking the stable-door
after the horse has been stolen.</p>

<p>We would suggest, therefore, that when dropping a
letter, newspaper, &amp;c. into a letter-box, always to see that
the packet falls into the basket or box, and does not stick
in its passage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SUGGESTIONS TO THE PUBLIC, ETC.</i></h3>

<p>The following sensible suggestions are taken from &#8220;The
British Postal Guide:&#8221; let us advise our readers to pay
some little attention to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see that every letter, newspaper, or other packet
sent by post is securely folded and sealed, and that, when
postage-stamps are remitted, they are enclosed in paper
sufficiently thick to prevent them from being seen or felt
through the cover. It should be remembered that every
such packet has to be several times handled, and that even
when in the mail-bag it is exposed to pressure and friction.
Unless, therefore, the article be light and pliant, it should
be enclosed in strong paper, linen, parchment, or some
other material which will not readily tear or break. The
observance of this precaution is especially necessary whenever
any fragile articles of value are forwarded by post.
These should always be enclosed in a wooden or tin box.
Owing to neglect of these precautions many postal packets
burst open, causing much trouble to the department and
risk to the owners, it being sometimes impossible to determine
to what packet a particular article belongs.</p>

<p>&#8220;To fasten the covers of newspapers firmly, so as to
prevent the contents from slipping out. When, for additional
security, the address is written on the newspaper
itself, such address (if the newspaper be franked by an
impressed stamp) must in case of re-transmission be cut
off; otherwise the newspaper will become subject to a
postage of 2<i>d.</i> It is not sufficient that the old address be
<i>obliterated</i>, as the rules forbid writing or marks of any
kind in addition to the true address.</p>

<p>&#8220;In affixing stamps, to wet slightly the corner of the
envelope and the gummed side of the stamp, and then
gently to press the stamp till it is firmly fixed. The
practice of dipping the stamp in water is objectionable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
because, unless the stamp be immediately withdrawn, and
care be taken by the use of blotting-paper or some other
absorbent to remove any excess of moisture, the gum may
be washed off, or the stamp may be rubbed off the letter.
By the use of envelopes bearing an <i>embossed</i> stamp (which
can be purchased at any post-office), all risk of the stamp
being detached may be avoided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never to send money or any other article of value
through the post, except either by means of a money-order
or in a registered letter. Any person who sends
money or jewelry in an unregistered letter not only runs
a risk of losing his property, but exposes to temptation
every one through whose hands his letter passes, and may
be the means of ultimately bringing some clerk or letter-carrier
to moral ruin. Every letter which contains money
or other valuable article, even when registered, ought to
be securely sealed.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>FORBIDDEN ARTICLES.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Postmasters are instructed not to receive any letter,
&amp;c. which there is good reason to believe contains any
thing likely to injure the contents of the mail-bag or the
person of any officer of the post-office. If such a packet
be posted without the postmaster&#8217;s knowledge, or if at any
time before its despatch he should discover any such
packet, he is directed not to forward it, but to report the
case, with the address of the packet, to the secretary. The
following are examples of the articles referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A glass bottle, or glass in any form; razors, scissors,
needles, knives, forks, or other sharp instruments; leeches,
game, fish, meat, fruit, or vegetables; bladders or other
vessels containing liquids; gunpowder, lucifer matches, or
any thing which is explosive or combustible.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LETTER-CARRIERS, THEIR COMPENSATION, ETC.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;Letter-carriers shall be employed as the postmaster-general
shall direct, at a compensation not exceeding $800
a year, which may be increased to $1000 at offices where
the income will allow, on proof of the carrier&#8217;s fidelity,
diligence, and experience. Carriers must give bond. Deliveries
shall be made as frequently as the public interest
may require. No carrier&#8217;s fee or extra postage shall be
charged on letters delivered or collected by carriers.
Separate accounts must be kept of the expenses of the
carrier-service and of the receipts from <i>local</i> mail-matter;
and all such expenses must be paid from the income of
the office employing the carriers. Letter-carriers may be
employed, under contract between postmaster and publishers,
to deliver newspapers, periodicals, circulars, &amp;c.,
but such contracts must be first approved by the postmaster-general;
and the postmaster-general may also provide
for delivery by such carriers of small packets, not
exceeding four pounds each, at the rate of two cents for
each four ounces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attempts were made subsequent to the passage of this
law (1862) to have the salaries increased to $1000, urged
by the applicants in consequence of the high price of provisions.
In 1864 they were coolly informed that there
were plenty of people <i>outside</i> ready to step <i>inside</i> at the
same salary. The post-office would present a strange
appearance if this system was adopted, for the duties of
the office are not learned in a day. Under former administrations
it was the chief object of men in power to pay
their employees living wages and reward honesty, sobriety,
and attention to business by preferment. <i>It is not so now.</i></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ONE-CENT SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>The law authorizing the free delivery of mail-letters
and all other mail-matter by carriers took effect on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
first day of July, 1863. We much question if the change
has benefited the treasury of the department.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE DISTRIBUTION OF LETTERS IN EUROPE.</i></h3>

<p>Although we have expressed a doubt in relation to this
system with us, it may not apply to other countries. Here
it is expected that the income of an office will sustain its
own expenses, and hence every postmaster is anxious to
make his report to the department favorably to this
system. Carriers now receive a regular salary; before,
they depended in a great measure on the one-cent system,
which lessened the department&#8217;s expense for carriers&#8217; pay
more than one-third what it is now. The one cent was
received from the recipients of letters and papers, which
they paid freely, and not unfrequently made it two when
they came to settle with the carriers. Merchants and
others still consider the old plan the best, <i>having an idea
that they are better served</i>.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;The Wheeling Intelligencer&#8221; (1865) gives the following
&#8220;chapter of accidents&#8221;: it says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We received a letter several days ago from a gentleman,
enclosing an announcement of his marriage, and
stating that he had also enclosed the sum of seventy-five
cents to pay for it. The letter did not enclose the money;
but the next day we got another letter from the same
gentleman, stating that it had occurred to him, after he
had mailed the first note, that he had not enclosed the
money; &#8216;and I therefore,&#8217; says the second epistle, &#8216;enclose
to you the amount;&#8217; but, instead of seventy-five cents, the
letter only contained twenty-five. A day or two afterwards
we received two more letters from the same person,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
each enclosing fifty cents. The first of the two letters
stated that the writer, having discovered his mistake,
enclosed fifty cents more to make up the amount. In the
second letter the gentleman says, that &#8216;having learned that
the mail containing my last letter was destroyed by fire, I
enclose now another fifty cents.&#8217; Our friend&#8217;s singular
confusion is no doubt attributable to the fact which in
his original note he requested us to announce.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A SCENE AT THE PHILADELPHIA POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Didn&#8217;t like the idea.</span>&mdash;A single female, apparently
forty-five years of age, with a very scraggy neck and
weazened features, made her appearance yesterday afternoon
at the ladies&#8217; window in the post-office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to get back a letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I dropped it in the box over yonder. I want
to take it back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s against our rules, ma&#8217;am; I am not allowed to
give back a letter unless I know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, there&#8217;ll be a fuss here, that&#8217;s all: I want
my letter again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call the chief clerk, then, ma&#8217;am. You can make
the fuss with him, if you must have one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Booth was summoned. With his usual blandness
he asked the lady how the letter was directed, and to
whom. He obtained a prompt reply. He found that
the lady had dropped the letter into the box under the
general delivery-window. He produced it from the basket
after a little search, and returned it to her. She appeared
considerably pleased, brushed off the letter with her handkerchief,
and at once dropped it into the basket under
the ladies&#8217; window, before which she was standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought you wanted to take out the letter!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>&#8221;
said Mr. Booth, in some surprise. &#8220;Here you&#8217;ve mailed
it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right now,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
I wanted. I dropped the letter in the wrong place fust,
among the men&#8217;s letters. I hate the men, so I do. I
hain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have my letter mixed up with men&#8217;s letters,
nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dislike the male sex then, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate you mail folk, as I know on, wuss than
the rest on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the men, madam; you dislike them?&#8221; said Mr.
Booth, emphasizing the title of masculinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the men! Of course I hate &#8217;em. I wouldn&#8217;t
trust one of &#8217;em anigh me. They&#8217;re a deceivin&#8217;,
lyin&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>How the sentence would have been completed is more
than we can say. At this moment somebody trod upon
the tail of a vixenish-looking dog that followed the lady,
and, as she rushed out, others took her place at the
window. Mr. Booth feels flattered that, while hating
the male sex in general, she doesn&#8217;t hate the mail folks
in particular.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>WATCH THE WASTE PAPER.</i></h3>

<p>One of the postal regulations (sect. 217) is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The postmaster, or one of his assistants, in all cases,
<i>immediately</i> before the office is swept or otherwise cleared
of rubbish, is to collect and examine the waste paper
which has accumulated therein, in order to guard against
the possibility of loss of letters or other mail-matter
which may have fallen on the floor or have been intermingled
with such waste paper during the transaction of
business. The observance of this rule is strictly enjoined
upon all postmasters, and its violation will constitute a
grave offence. Postmasters should be careful to use, in
mailing letters or packets, all wrapping-paper fit to be
used again; and the sale of any such paper is strictly forbidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>A neglect of this section might lead to serious consequences,
inasmuch as letters are continually falling from
the tables and trays to the floor, and, unless looked after,
would unquestionably find their way to the &#8220;waste-bags.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proprietor of a paper-mill informed us that one
of the girls employed by him in separating the waste
paper purchased from postmasters had found several
letters, one of which contained $30 in Treasury notes, and
another contained a note for $500 and an order to cancel
stamp placed upon a note since it was signed, as stamps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
could not be obtained at the place where the note was
signed.</p>

<p>The above letters had been thrown into the waste paper
by some careless postmaster or clerks, and sold at two and
a half cents per pound; and some other postmaster or
clerks have been under suspicion of committing a depredation
upon those letters; and had this girl been dishonest
they might never have been able to convince the parties
interested of their innocence.</p>

<p>This is inexcusable carelessness; and postmasters who
read this article should see that they or their clerks are
not caught in this way.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SEALING-WAX.</i></h3>

<p>Under no circumstances use sealing-wax for postal purposes.
Wax should only be used for letters or documents
when a person is anxious to <i>display his seal or coat of
arms</i>, or where it may be required for a legal purpose, and
only then when they are more effectually secured.</p>

<p>The practice of sealing letters passing more particularly
through warm climates with wax is attended with much inconvenience,
and frequently with serious injury, not only
to the letters so sealed, but to the other letters in the mail,
from the melting of the wax and adhesion of the letters
to each other. The public are, therefore, recommended in
all such cases to use either wafers or gum, and to advise
their correspondents in the countries referred to to do the
same.</p>

<p>English newspapers&mdash;indeed, nearly all European printed
matter&mdash;come to us sealed with <i>bad wax</i>; and if many of
them were not secured by thread, few would ever reach
the parties to whom they are addressed.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>COMPLAINTS ABOUT MISTAKES.</i></h3>

<p>When complaint is made of letters or newspapers lost,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
miscarried, or delayed, to furnish information as precise as
possible regarding all the facts of the case, and to enclose
whatever documents may throw light upon it. The day
and hour at which the letter or newspaper was posted, as
well as the office at which and the person by whom this
was done, should always be stated, and, when possible, the
cover or wrapper, in an entire state, should be sent, in order
that the place of delay may be ascertained by an examination
of the stamps. Cases frequently occur in which complaint
is made against the post-office and redress expected,
although little or no means of tracing the error and of
guarding against a repetition of it is supplied by those
who alone are able to do so.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>A LAW CASE.</i></h3>

<p>In 1806 a case was tried in the District Court of Maryland,
&#8220;United States <i>vs.</i> Barney,&#8221; which we deem essential
to the nature of our work.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Winchester, J.</span>&mdash;The indictment in this case, which
charges the defendant with having wilfully obstructed the
passage of the public mail at Susquehanna River, is
founded on the act of Congress of March, 1799.</p>

<p>&#8220;The defendant sets up as a defence and justification of
this obstruction of the mail that he had fed the horses
employed in carrying the mail for a considerable time, and
that a sum of money was due to him for food furnished
at and before the time of their arrest and detention.</p>

<p>&#8220;On this state of the facts, two questions have been
agitated:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1st, Whether the right of an innkeeper to detain a
horse for his food extends to horses owned by individuals
and employed in the transportation of the public mail.
And,</p>

<p>&#8220;2d, Whether such right extends to horses belonging to
the United States, employed in that service.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The first question involves the consideration of principles
of some extent, and to decide correctly on the second
it may be necessary to state them generally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lien is generally defined to be a tie, hold, or security
upon goods or other things which a man has in his custody,
till he is paid what is due to him. From this definition
it is apparent that there can be no lien where the
property is annihilated or the possession parted with
voluntarily and without fraud. 2 <i>Vern.</i> 117; 1 <i>Atk.</i> 234.</p>

<p>&#8220;The claim of a lien otherwise well founded cannot be
supported if there is&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1st, A particular agreement made and relied on.
<i>Sayer&#8217;s </i> Rep. 224; 2 <i>R. A.</i> 92. Or,</p>

<p>&#8220;2d, Where the particular transaction shows that there
was no intention that there should be a lien, but some
<i>other security is looked to and relied upon</i>. 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2223.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, therefore, in this case the agreement between the defendant
and the public agent actually was that he should be
paid for feeding the public horses on as low terms as any
other person on the road would supply them, he could not
justify detaining the horses; for the particular agreement
thus made, and under which the food was furnished, is the
foundation of the remedy of the defendant, and it can be
pursued in no other manner than upon that agreement.
Or, if there was no particular agreement, this case is such
that between the defendant and a private owner of horses
and carriages employed in transporting the mail I incline
to think it could not legally be presumed a lien was ever
intended or contemplated. A carrier of the mail is bound
not to delay its delivery, under severe penalties; and it can
scarcely be supposed that he would expose himself to the
penalty for such delay by leaving his horses subject to
the arrest of every innkeeper on the road for their food,
or that in such case the innkeeper could look to any other
security than the personal credit of the owner of the horses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
for reimbursement. But the law on such a case could be
only declared on facts admitted by the parties or found by
the jury, and is not now before the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;3d, The great question in this case rests on a discrimination
between the property of the government and individuals.&#8221;</p>

<p>After defining the constitutional rights of the government
and its general power to lay and collect taxes, duties,
imposts, and excise, to pay the debts and provide for the
common defence and general welfare of the United States,
and quoting numerous authorities, the judge concludes
with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>A stolen horse found in the mail-stage.</i> The owner
cannot seize him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The driver being in debt, or even committing an
offence, can only be arrested in such way as does not
obstruct the passage of the mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;These examples are as strong as any which are likely
to occur; but even these are not excepted by the statute;
and probably considerations of the extreme importance to
the government and individuals of the regular transmission
of public despatches and private communications may
have excluded these exceptions. But whatever may have
been the policy which led to the adoption of the law,
which the court will not inquire into, it totally prohibits
any obstruction to the passage of the mail. It is the duty
of the court to expound and execute the law, and therefore
I am of opinion and decide that the defendant is not
justified.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>POSTAGE-STAMPS.</i></h3>

<p>Connected with stamps, whether used as a currency or
for the increase of revenue, there are many curious and
interesting circumstances. The idea of producing a revenue
by the sale of stamps and stamped paper in America
was promulgated almost forty years before its final development
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
in legislative enactment in 1765. Sir William Keith
advised the policy as early as 1728. In 1739 the London
merchants advised the ministry to adopt the measure, and
public writers from time to time suggested various schemes
predicated upon the same idea. In 1770, Douglas, in his
work on &#8220;British America,&#8221; recommended the levying of
a stamp duty upon all legal writings and instruments.
Dr. Franklin regarded the plan favorably, and Governor
Sharpe, of Maryland, was confident in 1754 that Parliament
would speedily make a statute for raising money
by means of stamp duties. Lieutenant-Governor Delancey
spoke in favor of it in the New York Assembly in
1755, and the following year Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts,
urged Parliament to adopt a stamp tax. The
British press urged the measure in 1757, and it was
confidently stated that at least three hundred thousand
dollars annually might thus be drawn from the colonies
without the tax being sensibly felt. The tax bill became
a law in 1765 and was repealed in 1766. Had not ministers
been deceived by the representations of the stupid and
selfish governors in America, it probably would never
have been enacted. Those men were frequently too indolent
or indifferent to make themselves acquainted with the
real temper of the people. Regarding the mass as equally
servile as their flatterers, they readily commended that
fatal measure which proved the spark that lighted the
flame of the Revolution and severed forever the political
connection between Great Britain and the thirteen American
colonies. The stamp so carefully and so artistically
prepared, bearing upon its imposing front the crown and its
motto, &#8220;<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>,&#8221; and intended to enhance
the power and might of kingly rule, sealed the doom of
monarchy in the colonies forever!</p>

<p>The use of stamps, however, apart from tax purposes,
is not of modern invention, but for postal purposes they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
bear date quite recent. Stamps of one penny and twopence
each were first introduced in England on the 6th of May,
1840.</p>

<p>When Victoria succeeded to the British crown&mdash;midsummer,
1837&mdash;there were eleven thousand parishes in
England and Wales, and only three thousand post-offices.
A fourth of the population were entirely destitute of
postal accommodation. Four hundred of the registration
districts, the average extent of which was nearly twenty
square miles, were without a post-office. In 1839 the
number of chargeable letters was in the proportion of <i>four</i>
a year to each person of the population of England and
Wales, <i>three</i> in Scotland, and <i>one</i> in Ireland. In 1864
the proportion of letters is twenty-four a year to each of
the population of England and Wales, nineteen in Scotland,
and nine to Ireland. The increase from 76,000,000
letters in 1849 to 600,000,000 in 1864 is really an increase
of nearly seven hundred per cent. A stamped envelope was
used at first (consisting of a very absurd allegorical group,
said to have been improved by Mulready, the eminent
painter, from a drawing by Queen Victoria herself!); but
this was superseded, in a few months, by a stamp called
&#8216;penny blac&#8217; compulsory prepayment, which was begun in England, has
become the rule in the many countries which have adopted
Hill&#8217;s postal reform. This reform, which went into operation
in England on January 10, 1840, was not adopted
in the United States until July 1, 1845.</p>

<p>Perhaps no country in the world has ever yet produced
such a number of stamps as the United States of America.
Foreign nations limit their postal stamps; we issue them
in quantity and variety to meet the demands of the public
without stint or hindrance. The denominations of postal
stamps in the United States are 1 cent, 2 cent, 3 cent, 5
cent, 10 cent, 12 cent, 24 cent, 30 cent, and 90 cent.</p>

<p>The postage-stamp system has been adopted in all parts
of the world, by over ninety different kingdoms, states,
provinces, colonies, islands, and free cities,&mdash;in fifty different
parts of Europe, in over a dozen parts of Asia, including
China, in some twenty parts of the New World, in every
province of British North America, in seven parts of
Africa, and even in St. Helena on one side and the Sandwich
Islands on the other. There are postage-stamps used
in Ceylon; but the Japanese have not as yet arrived at
that period in perfection which would lead them towards
its attainment.</p>

<p>The stamps of the secessionists command a high price
in foreign markets,&mdash;probably as much for their having
the head of &#8220;Jeff Davis&#8221; on them than for any artistic
skill or beauty attached to them. When the rebellion
broke out, of course a line was drawn between the two
sections of our country, leaving the South in possession
of slavery and its fruits, and the North, with its vast
amount of wealth, intellect, and artistic power, to contend
against the world. Of course the South, heretofore dependent
on the North for every thing genius, art, and
skill produced, found they could not have a stamp cut
that would even do credit to their bogus government.
The first ones produced presented a most <i>counterfeit</i>-like
appearance of something once belonging to art: even Jeff
Davis became ashamed of them, and he applied to his
good friend and secret ally, Napoleon of France, for
assistance. Something better was produced by a French
artist; and thus the stamps came over with a variety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
other things to strengthen the Southern Confederacy and
assist her in maintaining something of the appearance of
a people who could claim some consideration among other
<i>advanced</i> nations of the world.</p>

<p>Connected with the issue of postal stamps is that strange
mania which seizes upon a certain class to collect and
treasure up every thing that is termed <i>unique</i> or new in
art or science. These stamps in time will become relics,
and possess an interest for the antiquarian equal to that
of old coins.</p>

<p>To such an extent is this passion carried, that in Europe
cabinets are formed and albums invented wherein these
stamps are fancifully arranged. In many instances men
make such collections a matter of business, and these receptacles
for stamps bring very high prices,&mdash;in fact, like
old coins, many of them command fabulous prices. The
collection of these miniature paper currency circulating
mediums is decidedly a British institution. Periodicals
devoted to the interest of dealers are established in various
parts of the kingdom, and agents employed, not only to
furnish information upon the subject of new issues, but to
procure various stamps for orders. The demand in England
for American stamps is great, and they command&mdash;more
particularly those of the Southern Confederacy&mdash;very
high prices.</p>

<p>We have no objection to this, although a strange fancy
on the part of those who are seized with the mania, because
it opens a new trade for the enterprising speculator
on the infirmity of human nature. A house in New York
advertises for &#8220;correspondents all over the world,&#8221; for
furnishing and supplying it with <i>stamp news</i>. Another
in Montreal advertises &#8220;stamps cheaper than ever:&#8221; these
consist of foreign, British colonial, and European stamps
of all kinds. The number of North American is enumerated
at fifty varieties.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>Connected, however, with the various stamps now in
use in this country is the necessity of teaching to our
youth their use and application to banks, custom-houses,
railroads, post-offices, pawnbrokers, and, in fact, as stamp
tax to every trade, business, and department of government.</p>

<p>In several of our commercial colleges an actual stamp
department is invented, and mock-banks, custom-houses,
steamboat-offices, post-offices, &amp;c., are fitted up for the purpose
of familiarizing youth with their use in the various
mercantile and governmental departments of the country.
This is what we term the best and most useful knowledge
that the stamps can impart to those who are so anxious to
treasure them up in albums and cabinets.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>We annex the following article from Appleton&#8217;s &#8220;United
States Postal Guide&#8221;[1864]:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the <i>Sonora</i>, a few days since, says a Californian
correspondent, some two hundred of Uncle Sam&#8217;s orphans
arrived, and were distributed around. Some were sent to
Fort Alcastra, some to the barracks at the Presidio, and
the remainder were quartered at Benicia barracks, preparatory
to being assigned to the different companies of
the regiments in this department. They will soon be
scattered from Oregon to that most delightful post, Fort
Yuma, in Arizona,&mdash;a place where they have to put rocks
on the roofs to keep the ends of the boards from curling
over like little dogs&#8217; tails. It is a wretched place to live
at, and to be ordered there is enough to make any officer
resign, unless a Catholic, who acknowledges the justice of
being sent to purgatory. They have a little fun even in
that awful place sometimes, and an officer was telling me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
the other day of how he lost his postage-stamps. He had
sent up here for some twenty dollars&#8217; worth, and had left
them on his table. Now, the habits, manners, and customs
thereabouts are considerably on the free-and-easy
style, and the Indians are allowed to roam around the
garrison <i>ad libitum</i>, if they behave themselves and do not
steal. On this occasion a young squaw, who had the run
of the quarters, and was very much at home anywhere
and everywhere, happened to stray into my friend&#8217;s room,
and, seeing the postage-stamps, began to examine them
with great curiosity. She discovered they would stick if
wet, and forthwith a happy idea struck her. Now, the
fashionable dress of the ladies of her class in that warm
climate is of the briefest description. She was ambitious
to dress up and excite the envy of the other Pocahontases.
So she went in on the postal currency, and, much to the
astonishment of the garrison, made her appearance presently
on the parade-ground entirely covered over with
postage-stamps. She was stuck all over with Benjamin
Franklin, and the Father of his Country was plastered
all over her ladyship&#8217;s glossy skin indiscriminately, regardless
of dignity and decency. The &#8216;roar&#8217; that greeted her,
from the commanding officer down to the drummer-boys,
was loud enough to be heard nearly at head-quarters in
San Francisco; but, Indian-like, she preserved her equanimity,
and did not seem at all disconcerted, but sailed off
with the air and step of a genuine princess, while my
friend rushed into his quarters to discover himself minus
his twenty dollars&#8217; worth of postage-stamps, and that what
was intended for the mail had been appropriated to the
female. She might have been put in the overland coach
and gone through: she certainly could not have been
stopped for want of being prepaid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>REPORT OF MR. GEORGE PLITT.</i></h3>

<p>Amos Kendall, postmaster-general from 1835 to 1840,
anxious to have the postal department as perfect as human
efforts can avail towards such a state of things, sent the
gentleman whose name heads this article to Europe for
the purpose of adding to our store of knowledge on postal
matters. Mr. Plitt was well calculated for this mission,
having served seven years in the New York post-office,
and was familiar with its operations. He left New York
in the month of June, 1839, and returned in August, 1840,
after having visited &#8220;the post-office departments of England,
Scotland, France, Belgium, Saxony, Prussia, Austria,
Bavaria, Wirtemberg, Baden, and the free Hanseatic cities
of Frankfort, Hamburg, Bremen, and Lubeck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among other reforms and suggestions made in Mr.
Plitt&#8217;s report are the abolition of the franking privilege,
the prepayment of all letters, as well as of newspapers
and all printed matter. He strongly urges the reduction
of postage, and quotes the English postal law as an evidence
of its pecuniary advantages. As many of the reforms
suggested, based on the European system, have been
introduced into ours, and nearly every other improvement
carried into the department, it is not necessary for us here
to name them; but, at the same time, it is due to Mr.
Plitt to state that his report met with a cordial response
from the department, whose instructions he had so ably
carried out, and whose ideas on and about foreign mail
arrangements afforded it an opportunity to improve those
of our own.</p>

<p>He also suggested the establishing special agents and
mail-guards. In Europe they form a prominent feature
in their system; but as regards the necessity of the latter
in this country, we doubt if their services would be required,
unless in time of war, frontier insurrections, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
disgraceful rebellions, such as a vile portion of the land
had inaugurated, and over whose downfall and ruin our
nation&#8217;s flag is now proudly uprising. It will float again,&mdash;float
in its might and power over every foot of land
that Columbia calls her own; but not until</p>

<p class="center f8">
&#8220;Bold rebellion&#8217;s blood has all been drain&#8217;d.&#8221;
</p>

<p>The subject of the reduction of postage had been agitated
in Congress before Mr. Plitt&#8217;s visit to Europe. In
1836, Edward Everett proposed measures for that purpose,
but no well-digested plan was brought forward.
<i>There was no Benjamin Franklin there to propose one.</i> In
1843, three years after Mr. Plitt&#8217;s return from Europe,
the general discontent of the people on the subject of
postage was expressed in the form of resolutions by the
legislatures of several States, instructing their Senators
and requesting their Representatives in Congress to take
some measures for a reduction. Mr. C. A. Wickliffe, at
that time postmaster-general, made some investigation in
regard to the English system, and in an elaborate report
advocated some reduction, but not a radical one, on the
ground that the department would become a heavy charge
upon the government if large reductions were made. Subsequent
reductions far greater than those proposed at that
period show how much the postmaster-general and those
who sustained him in this idea were mistaken. It was
not until 1845 that Congress was enabled to pass a bill for
a reduction. March 3, 1845, a bill was passed, which went
into operation July 1, 1845. Its rates were as follows:&mdash;for
a letter not exceeding a half-ounce in weight, whether
of one or more pieces of paper, under three hundred miles,
five cents; over three hundred miles, ten cents, and an
additional rate for every additional half-ounce or fraction
of a half-ounce. Advertised letters, two cents; pamphlets,
magazines, &amp;c., per ounce, two cents, and each additional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
ounce, one cent. Newspapers, under thirty miles, free;
over thirty and under one hundred, or any distance within
the State where published, one cent; over one hundred
and out of the State, one and a half cent. At various
periods since, changes have been made, until it is now
reduced to a system based on the lowest rates, which
under proper and efficient management must, and no
doubt will, result in self-sustaining the department: certain
abuses have of course to be corrected.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ENGLISH POST-OFFICE.</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Plitt states in his report that the number of persons
employed in the English post-office, London, is one thousand
nine hundred and three.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> This number comprises
all the letter-carriers and receivers employed within a
circle of twelve miles from the post-office. In this circle
letters are delivered at the residence of the person addressed
and taken up from the receiving-houses five times
per day. There is besides an inner circle of three miles
from the post-office, within which there are seven deliveries
per day, and also seven collections from the receiving-houses,
to go by the general post, as late as five o&#8217;clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>FRANKING PRIVILEGE.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;This privilege is entirely abolished under the late new
law. Members of Parliament, even before the law was
passed, were restricted as to the number of letters they
were allowed to frank, and were, besides, obliged to put
the day of the month upon each letter franked by them.&#8221;
The privilege, however, was not <i>entirely</i> abolished, inasmuch
as it was granted to the Minister of Finance and
some of his agents.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>PENNY POSTAGE.</i></h3>

<p>Stamps of one penny and twopence each were first introduced
on the 6th of May, 1840, and since that period
there has been an increase of nearly three hundred thousand
letters. Mr. Plitt strongly advocates the cheap
postage system.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>LETTER-CARRIERS IN PARIS.</i></h3>

<p>In Paris, where there are six deliveries of the &#8220;Petite
Poste&#8221; per day, the carriers of the General and &#8220;Petite
Poste&#8221; letters are the same. In a report made by Rowland
Hill on the French post-office, in October, 1839,
speaking of this plan, he says, &#8220;The plan of employing
one set of letter-carriers for the delivery of all letters
appears to work exceedingly well in Paris. All that I
heard and saw in Paris tends to confirm the opinion I
have already expressed, that great convenience and economy
would result from the union of the two bodies in London.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>INDECENT POSTAL MATTER.</i></h3>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sec. 16.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That no obscene
book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a
vulgar and indecent character shall be admitted into the
mails of the United States; and any person or persons
who shall deposit or cause to be deposited in any post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>-office
or branch post-office of the United States, for mailing
or for delivery, an obscene book, pamphlet, picture,
print, or other publication, knowing the same to be of a
vulgar and indecent character, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and, being duly convicted thereof, shall for
every such offence be fined not more than five hundred
dollars, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both,
according to the circumstances and aggravations of the
offence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apart from this act, there is an understanding between
the postmaster-general and postmasters generally relative
to obscene and vulgar postal matter. So far as the secrets
of the office are concerned, that understanding is &#8220;contraband.&#8221;
But this is not sufficient. If the post-office is to
be used as the medium through which the vilest works of
art pass so readily, and calculated to corrupt the innocent
and excite the passions of youth by high-colored pictures,
the public, at least, should know how and why so many
reach the persons to whom they are directed, and to what
extent this espionage extends. It would require no breach
of the observance of postal rules to ascertain almost at a
glance the nature of the book or picture which comes
under the head of &#8220;indecent postal matter.&#8221; These publications,
varying in accordance to the artistic taste of the
originators, pass through the office in the shape of splendid
photograph albums, handsomely-bound books, embossed
prints, transparent cards, and &#8220;yellow-cover pamphlets,&#8221;
<i>&agrave; la Dr. Young</i>, and photograph cards of a most indecent
character. At other times they are posted as letters, addressed
chiefly to young ladies, containing a card and
making the most dishonorable proposals. In several
instances the parents have shown the author these letters,
and upon a close examination he feels satisfied that the
only motive the writer had was to corrupt and demoralize,
without the most distant idea of ever reaping the fruits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
of his villany. The imagination cannot conceive or pencil
paint a more hideous picture of a fiend than one who
would thus attempt to corrupt the young and innocent by
such means. The idea could only have been suggested by
the devil, and as readily carried out by his agent. Artists
of well-known reputation lend themselves to this work
of destruction; and specimens denote the highest order of
talent, as well as the most exquisite workmanship of
art,&mdash;art devoted to the production of the most vulgar
and disgusting subjects the human mind ever conceived
or a diseased imagination conjured. That very intellect
which should have shed a halo over the pure things of
earth is here devoted to the production of things evil.</p>

<p>A tendency to sap the foundation upon which rest the
pillars of morality, and to poison the minds of youth,
seems to be a prevailing vice. High literary attainments,
great mental powers, have been brought into the arena to
battle for crime, lasciviousness, and vice. In all ages the
vile corruption of man&#8217;s nature, aided by genius and
talent, has been manifested in the production of things
evil. The rapid and, we may say, alarming increase of
crime, the callousness manifested at the recital of human
suffering, the want, or, rather, the absence, of a correct
moral standard in every thing appertaining to social life,
the sneering at the tenets of our holy religion, the assumption
as it were of omniscient powers on the part of sinful
men, have led to a state of things which will require
stronger measures than that of mere reasoning to remedy.</p>

<p>Our streets of a night are flooded with the daughters
of vice; temples are dedicated to licentiousness, sanctioned
by the authorities, who grant them &#8220;license&#8221; as it were
to corrupt youth and demoralize the masses. Intemperance
and pauperism are the results of the &#8220;law&#8217;s license&#8221;
to common crime. Thus the dark shadow of vice extends
its fatal power over that portion of the human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
family from whose domestic circle the voice of prayer
never ascends. There instead is heard the sound of rattling
glasses: loud oaths, the bacchanalian song, there
throw around the circle of which they form the nucleus
an atmosphere to poison and destroy. Much of all this
can be traced to the estimate men place upon the modern
mode of education. If genius invents something that
places vice in a brilliant light, in and through which all
that is startling in picture-view or description presents
new features to the novice in licentiousness, it becomes at
once an institution from whence flows a stream that poisons
a city. In an instant these productions take miniature
shapes: art combines with the genius of the originators,
and, lo! they go forth through the post, spreading ruin
and desolation everywhere. It is that very facility which
the post affords that gives power and influence to these
fiends; and, alas! how many, dazzled by the &#8220;refinement
of vice,&#8221;&mdash;refined by the touch of art,&mdash;fall into the snare
by the very excitement they produce! Many of these
photographs of the more vile character reach &#8220;young
ladies&#8217; seminaries.&#8221; Many books of a similar character
find their way hither, and thus corruption works its way
to the ruin of their inmates.</p>

<p>We would have&mdash;what under no other circumstance
would we suggest to the department&mdash;<i>an espionage over
all suspicious postal matter</i>.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ESPIONAGE OVER THE POST-OFFICE IN FRANCE.</i></h3>

<p>That country must be in a bad way where the heads of
the several departments find it necessary to resort to the
most infamous means of tracing out suspected traitors.
Thus, in the postal department, every letter is subject to
the system of espionage, and the innocent as well as the
guilty alike suspected and their private correspondence
betrayed. In time of rebellion, insurrection, or an attempt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
to assassinate a king or an emperor, there might be
some excuse for the exercise of such precaution; but in
the absence of such startling causes the system is both
mean and cowardly. In France, at the present time
(1865), private letters, newspapers, and pamphlets are
subjected to the most anxious scrutiny. A large portion
of every day is devoted to such examinations by a skilful
and energetic body of men. Between the time when
letters are received at the chief office from the district-offices
and the time they are sent out again, two hours elapse.
<i>During this period they are in the hands of the police.</i> The
police have a list of certain addresses, and are furnished
with examples of the handwriting of every one in whose
correspondence the government is interested. With these
and practised eyes the officials set to work, carrying all
suspected letters into the Cabinet Noir, where they are
read, copied, delayed, stopped at discretion; and the police
are very discreet about seizing letters: it is done as seldom
as possible. The system is so perfect, it works so well,
that the only chance of evading it is to correspond under
assumed names, changed with every letter; and this is
actually done by people who are not more treasonable
than the majority of Frenchmen, but who, being eminent
and powerful, are condemned to the degradation of shifts
like these, or every letter they write would be read by the
police. Governments maintained thus are never safe in
power.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE POST-OFFICE SOLVENT.</i></h3>

<p>The following article we take from the &#8220;Philadelphia
North American and United States Gazette&#8221; of the 13th
July, 1865. The view the editor takes is simply, however,
from a hastily-arranged statement made shortly after
the appointment of Mr. Dennison as postmaster-general.
We have our doubts about its accuracy, inasmuch as the
short time for reductions of salary and other expenses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
would not lessen the debt against the postal department
and yield a surplus of seven hundred thousand dollars.
Well may the editor say, &#8220;<i>How long this is likely to continue
we cannot say.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the first time in many years the United States
Post-Office Department has become a paying institution,
the revenues of the last six months having yielded a surplus
of more than seven hundred thousand dollars above
the expenses, and the ensuing six months will tell still
better. How long this is likely to continue we cannot say.
During Mr. Blair&#8217;s administration of this department he
reduced the expenditures to such an extent as to afford an
astonishing contrast with the old Buchanan dynasty, when
the annual deficit of the department was five millions of
dollars. We thought Mr. Blair&#8217;s management unprecedently
good; but still he could not bring the department
to a paying standard, which his successor has now done
very handsomely. Mr. Dennison has done this by means
of a system of the most stringent and searching economy,
reducing the force of employees everywhere, cutting down
salaries and allowances, examining carefully into items of
expenditure, the management and compensation of contractors,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, Governor Dennison brought to the conduct of
our postal affairs the excellent training he had received in
the executive government of Ohio, like his predecessor in
that office, Mr. Chase, and he has looked carefully into
every thing under his charge with an eye to economy and
efficiency, and the service, instead of suffering by this
scrutiny, has been largely benefited. But with the renewal
of our authority in the South comes back a region
wherein before 1860 the postal service was always carried
on at a heavy loss to the National Government. It hardly
admits of a doubt that this deficit was owing solely to the
running of great numbers of useless mails to gratify local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
influences. This was consequent upon the predominance
of Southern politicians at Washington. Their demands
for favors of this kind were incessant, and, as they were
generally with the ruling element in Congress, they got
whatever they asked for. It may be inferred that modesty
was not one of their faults, and that they did not lose
any thing for the want of asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;In places where a weekly mail would have answered,
a daily, semi-weekly, or tri-weekly mail was run, and so
where a place of somewhat more consequence needed a
semi-weekly mail a daily mail would be run. Instead of
making every post-office a paying one, by making it the
depot for a sufficient population, swarms of unnecessary
offices were created to gratify local politicians, the effect
of which was that none were remunerative. We are sorry
to say that this evil afflicts the service in many parts of
the North, and that there is great need of discontinuing
offices now in existence. Sometimes the ambition or the
jealousy of villages led to this multiplication of useless
offices, but generally it was caused by the Congressmen
catering for their political supporters. Since the year
1860 the necessities of the government have compelled
the department to reduce both the number of these offices
and of the mails run. The deficiency always visible in
the postal revenues at the South, aside from the causes we
have referred to, arose also from the evil policy of the
slaveholding oligarchy. Four millions of the Southern
population were prohibited from a knowledge of reading
and writing, and of course the post-office was not needed
for them. The planter had no right to complain of being
reduced to a weekly mail; for in a region of six square
miles there might not be more than three families using
the post-office, the rest being all slaves, or illiterate &#8216;poor
white trash.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet these planters would make a vast deal of fuss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
about their mail facilities, and to satisfy them the National
Government sustained an annual loss of millions of dollars.
It was not only the prohibition of letters toward the slaves
that caused the loss, for the poor whites labored under no
such prohibition, and yet were as ignorant as the slaves;
but it was the total absence of all provision for the education
of the masses of the population throughout the
South. The poor whites could not read newspapers if
they received them; they could not write letters, nor
could they read them. Moreover, the mail-matter was
still further reduced by the refusal to allow anti-slavery
newspapers to circulate at all in the South. A merchant
could not receive the commercial papers of the North,
because of their sentiments about slavery; a clergyman
could not receive the religious papers of the North, for
the same reason. If a man in any of the interior districts
received frequent letters from the North, he would
be sure to find them a matter of inquisitorial questioning,
and would be obliged to give an idea of the nature of his
correspondence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question how the postal service can be rendered
permanently remunerative at the South involves three distinct
and very important considerations:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can the ignorant masses of the Southern population
be educated in a knowledge of reading, writing, and
arithmetic, and insured hereafter the benefits of a well-established
common free-school system for their children?</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we relieve the national mails of that infamous
espionage which, down to the present time, has been rigidly
enforced in every hole and corner of the South, sometimes
by the post-office itself, but generally by outside parties,
though always in the interest of the plantation aristocracy
and their political agents and domination?</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we prevent the renewal of the old evil of
supernumerary post-offices and superfluous mails all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
the South, and so gauge the service that each office shall
pay expenses and each mail be well filled with paying
matter?</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the problems to be solved, and it behooves
us all to reflect upon their exceeding difficulty when we
complain that our postal department is not better managed.
Although the franking system is bad enough in all conscience,
it is not responsible for the bulk of the postal
loss. From what we have said above, it must be plain
that the despotic social system, established for the benefit
of the plantation aristocracy, has been annually paid for
largely out of our pockets. We have paid five millions
of dollars annually as a premium upon Southern ignorance.
We have helped the planter to keep his slaves
and his poor white neighbors in ignorance and degradation,
and, in order the better to enable him to enforce his
cruel and abominable despotism, we have given him the
surveillance of our mails, and allowed him to terrorize
over them as he saw fit. Mr. Dennison, we can readily
believe, is not the man to put up with this hereafter; but
it requires vigilance to prevent it altogether, and the exercise
of other powers than his to remedy the great evil,&mdash;Southern
ignorance.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>SALARIES OF POSTMASTERS.</i></h3>

<p>Under the old postal arrangement, the salary of postmasters
of the principal cities was limited to $2000. This
compensation was derived from a commission out of their
receipts, which could not exceed the amount named. This
would appear at first as small pay for such an important
position,&mdash;more particularly as under the administration of
Postmaster Blair the salary was raised to $4000: yet there
is not a postmaster but would willingly go back to the
old system. Under the former provision of the postal
law postmasters were allowed the amount arising from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
the rent of letter-boxes in their respective offices as a
perquisite, and also certain other matters, which shrewd
men knew well how to place under this head. During
the existence of this system the desire for the office far
exceeded that which was and is likely to be manifested
under the latter, inasmuch as $4000 per annum and <i>no
perquisites</i> is scarcely a desirable position for an ambitious
and popular politician. Many a business-man, outside of
the political ring, would consider it quite sufficient, however:
<i>business-men are not cormorants</i>. It is true, even
under the old law, by an act passed March 3, 1847, the
rent of boxes to be credited to the postmaster was limited,
restricting the amount so received to $2000,&mdash;consequently
limiting his salary to $4000: for all over and above that
amount he had to account to the department. Under
some administrations postmasters became rich, whether by
husbanding their actual income or the perquisites are questions
simply of conjecture.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE PENNY POST.</i></h3>

<p>The first attempt to establish the penny post in the
United States was in the years 1839-40. It was simply
a speculation, and resulted at first in almost total failure,
but revived again under more enterprising parties. Previous
to this, however, contrary to the laws of Congress,&mdash;particularly
the law of 1825, sect. 19, which enacts that
no stage or other vehicle which regularly performs trips
on a post-road or on a road parallel to it, and no packet,
war, or other vessel which regularly plies on a water
declared a post-road, shall convey letters,&mdash;certain persons,
actually availing themselves of these modes of conveyance,
<i>constituted</i> themselves &#8220;private posts,&#8221; travelling
as passengers, and carried packages containing valuable letters,
documents, and other available matter: these were,
of course, transported as baggage or freight. The conveyances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
used by these men passed regularly over post-roads,
and thus they travelled in company with their
powerful opponent, &#8220;the post-office department.&#8221; It was
also well known to the department; but as they <i>were not
special posts</i>, the law of 1825 did not reach them. Still
their system was a secret one, and hard to be detected.
The law, however, of 1827, sect. 3, enacts that no person
other than the postmaster-general or his authorized agents
shall set up any foot- or horse-posts for the conveyance of
letters and packets upon any post-road which is or may
be established as such by law.</p>

<p>This law paved the way for the establishing penny
posts by individuals in cities and even in rural districts.
At first they were called expresses, but soon they assumed
a more postal shape. The postmaster-general&#8217;s annual report
of December 2, 1843, stated that &#8220;numerous private
posts, under the name of expresses, had sprung within a
few years into existence, extending themselves over the
mail-routes between the cities and towns, and transporting
letters and other mailable matter for pay to a great extent.&#8221;
Suits were commenced against parties residing in
New York, Massachusetts, and Maryland. It appears
from the postmaster-general&#8217;s report of November 25,
1844, that the government had been unable to suppress
the private expresses, which were still continued &#8220;upon
the leading post-routes.&#8221; In this and in the former annual
report he recommended legislation by Congress for their
suppression. There is yet no law of Congress to suppress
these expresses. Governments, more particularly that of
ours, cannot enact laws that will interfere with the commercial
interests of the people. It may facilitate every
movement by such laws as are legitimate; but taking
out of the hands of individuals their <i>legitimate</i> business,
connected with no department of the government, becomes
at once not only a monopoly, but assumes the complexion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
of tyranny. The decision of the judges in the cases referred
to settled the question, until compromise stepped in
and the government came down to the &#8220;penny system,&#8221;
and thus satisfied the public.</p>

<p>In 1860 Mr. Holt, the postmaster-general, by virtue
of the act of March 3, 1851, by a formal order declared
all the streets, lanes, avenues, &amp;c. within the corporate
limits of the cities of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia,
to be post-roads, and notified all engaged in the
transportation and delivery of letters for compensation in
said cities, that they would expose themselves to the
penalties imposed by the third section of the act of
March, 1827. The private expresses in the cities named
acquiesced in the legality of the step, with the exception
of one in Philadelphia long and familiarly known as
&#8220;Blood&#8217;s Express,&#8221; and subsequently, &#8220;Despatch.&#8221; In
despite of the act of 1851, or the penalty imposed under
that of 1827, Blood&#8217;s Express continued its regular delivery
of letters in defiance of the department. A bill in
equity was filed with a view of restraining the company
from this habitual and persistent violation of the postal
laws; but, upon full argument and consideration had on
the questions involved, the injunction was denied.</p>

<p>The mere existence of a postal department of the government
is not an establishment of monopoly. No government
has ever organized a system of posts without
securing to itself a monopoly of the carriage of letters
and mailable matter; but this was never intended to
control individual enterprise in the express line. Judge
Grier, who indorses the decision of this case, says,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> &#8220;The
business of private carriers of letters and mailable packets,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
even on principal mail-routes, is lawful unless legislatively
prohibited. A private monopoly, secured by
prohibitory legislation, cannot require the suppression
of a rival business of competitors who do not infringe
the prohibition, merely because the continuance of their
business would lessen or destroy the profits of his monopoly.
A like rule applies in determining the effect
of a government&#8217;s legislative prohibitions to secure its
own postal monopoly. The monopoly cannot be extended
beyond the legislative prohibitions, merely because the
continuance of a specific business which has not been
prohibited would reduce the postal earnings of the government,
or even frustrate the purposes of its exclusive
policy.&#8221; Streets, lanes, alleys, and avenues were not, in
the opinion of the judge, &#8220;post-routes.&#8221; Public streets
intersecting a municipal town are as highways distinguishable
specifically from the general public highways
of a State beyond the town limits. The streets are, indeed,
as thoroughfares, general public highways of the
State; but, independently of this character of thoroughfares,
the streets are specially <i>local highways</i> of the town.
Internal affairs of municipal towns affecting their local
interests alone are always regulated more or less by their
local governments. So far as these streets over which the
mail may be carried are entitled to be termed &#8220;post-roads
for the passage of the mail,&#8221; there is no question; but
whether Congress has the right to declare the streets of a
city post-roads for any purpose is questionable.</p>

<p>When Blood&#8217;s Express was first established, its main
object was to accommodate merchants, mechanics, and
professional men generally, by furnishing a medium of
communication with their customers, clients, &amp;c., which
would anticipate the slow movements of the old postal
mode of delivery. If this continued to be its legitimate
object, it is very probable the commercial community<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
would have taken a much greater interest in it than they
did; but, unfortunately for this new postal system, it
assumed the character of a &#8220;Parisian Bureau,&#8221; for the
reception and delivery of small documents, wherein &#8220;love,
courtship, and marriage&#8221; were all treated with an eye to
<i>excitement</i> rather than as a virtuous incentive to their study
and moral consequences. Young and inexperienced girls
were gradually led into (initial) correspondence with &#8220;fast
young men;&#8221; foolish widows and old maids to advertise
for husbands, and equally silly, weak-minded elderly
gentlemen to imitate their example. Added to this,
many made this penny system the medium to originate
practical jokes, and thus the &#8220;express&#8221; became a sort of
Pandora&#8217;s (<i>postal</i>) box for &#8220;all sorts of people&#8221; to try
experiments with fickle fortune, either by marriage or
swindling. Both in some instances succeeded.</p>

<p>The same was attempted when the government took
charge of the &#8220;express;&#8221; but the department soon put a
stop to this nonsensical practice by ignoring as legitimate
matter every thing of an <i>initial</i> character. Young girls,
foolish widows, old maids, and weak-minded men, who
could without much publicity send and receive communications
through &#8220;Blood&#8217;s Express,&#8221; found a post-office
somewhat too dignified an institution for their <i>childish</i> intellects.</p>

<p>Still, this class of people,&mdash;and it takes all kinds to make
up a world,&mdash;added to another class who make of crime a
pastime and licentiousness a pleasure, adopted other modes
of carrying on their &#8220;vocation,&#8221; which we here allude to
under the head of &#8220;Indecent postal matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was seated at my desk; the index-box was filled with
letters,&mdash;the great Southern mail having just arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any letters for me, sir,&mdash;Henry Middleton?&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced my eyes at the applicant: there was something
in his voice, look, and manner which for a moment riveted
my attention. He appeared by no means annoyed at my
scrutiny of his person, no doubt ascribing it to the nature
of our situation. He was apparently about twenty-three
years of age; eyes dark and penetrating; a shade of melancholy
passed over his countenance and withered the sunshine
of hope; a mouth of the most marked character
conveyed to the observer a knowledge of his; the lower
lip firmly compressed, and the curl of the upper denoted
strong and agitated feeling, and an irritable temperament.
Having gathered this much from Henry Middleton&#8217;s personal
appearance, I took out from the box M a handful
of letters. One was addressed to him: the handwriting
was evidently that of a female. He seized it with a
nervous grasp, a momentary gleam of hope lighted up
his shadowy countenance, and he rushed out of the office.
For the first time in my life I felt a degree of curiosity to
know the contents of another&#8217;s letter: it was a strange
and to me a new feeling. In vain I battled with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
demon which seemed rising within me; in vain I turned
over letter after letter to withdraw my mind from this
dangerous focus of thought: it was utterly useless. That
night I dreamed of being condemned for breaking open
letters intrusted to my charge.</p>

<p>Towards evening on the day following, to my extreme
joy Henry Middleton stood at the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to pay the postage of this letter, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twenty-five cents I informed him was the charge. The
letter was in my hand: Middleton had departed. The
address, Miss Amelia Templeton,&mdash;a small seal with the
impression M upon it,&mdash;was the padlock to my curiosity.
My brain grew giddy with the intensity of desire. I held
the epistle up to the light,&mdash;the paper was coarse and
thick. I peeped into the folds: ah! what is that?&mdash;part
of a sentence visible:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love, Amelia, acknowledges no tie but that of its own
creation.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a sentence! In vain I tried to follow it up; not
a word beyond this could I make out. Here I was left
in the dark: then my imagination completed a volume
of surmises. He, Middleton, was endeavoring to persuade
Amelia to elope with him, or rather to follow him
here, and the above line constituted a portion of the
argument used by him to effect this object.</p>

<p>Such were my conjectures relating to the affair, derived
from such evidence as the reader is now acquainted with.</p>

<p>A month passed over, and my note-book contained
several incidents of an interesting nature; but the lovers,
as I concluded them to be, occupied so much of my
thoughts that I could pay but very little attention to the
rest. I awaited impatiently the return of the mail which
should bring the answer from Amelia. At length it came.
To Henry Middleton. I instinctively caught it up. I
felt as if I were an interested person, and had a right to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
see&mdash;that is, without breaking the seal&mdash;as much of the
letter as I could; but Amelia had folded it so carefully
that it defied all attempts to gather any connected sentence.
Gracious heavens! what do I see? By turning
up a portion of the inner fold with the blade of my knife,
I read,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Yours, affectionately,</p>

<p class="center padl5">Amelia Sinclair.</p>

<p>It was now certain that Amelia was lost to Henry.
She had proved faithless by marrying another. How
would he bear up against the thunderbolt aimed direct at
his heart? I again endeavored to penetrate further into
this letter: another fold was carefully raised; the words,
&#8220;a parent&#8217;s curse,&#8221; &#8220;cruel necessity,&#8221; &#8220;your absence,&#8221;
&#8220;forced into marriage,&#8221; burst upon my sight. I had
actually worked myself into a fever, and had partly determined
to keep the letter from Middleton, feeling assured
that its contents would prove a death-blow to his hopes.
While debating the subject with myself, he appeared at
the window. I held the letter in my hand. A tremor
of almost conscious guilt passed over me, and, if he had
watched my countenance, he could not have failed to
detect something indicative of my crime. I handed him
the letter: he gazed upon the well-known hand, a smile
of joy irradiated his visage; he tore it open, hastily devouring
its contents; a sudden and awful change came
over his face; the exclamation of &#8220;oh, God!&#8221; escaped
him: he raised his right arm, pressing the distended
fingers against his forehead, and fell upon the floor in
horrid convulsions!</p>

<p class="center padl1"><span class="gesperrt">*******</span></p>

<p>He lay upon the bed of death,&mdash;his eyes partly closed,
and his hands clasped together in convulsive agony. I
stood beside him, awaiting the result of the paroxysm. In
a few moments he regained consciousness: he gazed languidly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
around the room, exclaiming, &#8220;Where am I?
Who did this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;who is willing to serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, as you are my friend, burn that fatal letter!
While it exists, I am wretched: it is the curse of the few
short moments I have yet to live. I have read it until
each word, nay, each letter, seemed as a coal of fire consuming
my very heart-strings. It is chained to my brain,
and each thought I bestow upon it acts as an electric
shock to heighten my misery. I essayed to destroy it;
but dared not,&mdash;cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the letter and deliberately burned it: he watched
its disappearance with a maddening glare, and, when it
was entirely burned to ashes, he burst into a hysterical
laugh, and fell back upon the bed.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to inform the reader that, after
the scene at the post-office, I caused him to be conveyed
to my room, and he had continued in a state of delirium
during the whole of that time. On recovering from the
hysterical affection caused by the excitement of destroying
the letter, he became more calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;I remember it all, and
you have been my true friend. Heaven will bless you for
it: my prayers&mdash;they are all I have to offer&mdash;shall be
breathed for thee and thine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Compose yourself,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;think of nothing
now but your recovery and return to your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends!&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Who talks of friends? Ah!
yes; you that are a real one, and never felt the venomed
tooth of a smiling hypocrite in your flesh. No, I will
speak; bear with me a while. Think, only! he was my
chum at college, the companion of my youth, the friend
of my more matured age, and we lived in the hope of
ending our days beneath the same roof; but now the
broad canopy of heaven cannot shelter both of us alive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
One or the other should&mdash;must die, and fate accords it
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You distress yourself. Do not speak of these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak of them, my dear sir, to drive away the curse
of recollection. Left alone to dwell upon them, I would
go mad. I will relate to you something of my short but
eventful history. It is simple; there is no romance in it:
it is one of those incidents which occur in every life among
men of the world. I was not suited for the world: it has
crushed me. Amelia has wounded the heart that loved
her. But no more of that. We were cousins, destined at
an early age by our parents for each other. We grew up
in the perfect knowledge of the happiness which awaited
us: we were young, we were lovers. There is not a
stream, there is not a mountain of our native home, but
could tell a tale of our early loves. We have wandered
over the one and sat beside the other, when the moon
shed her pale and silvery light upon its waters. There
nature smiled upon us, and we in return rejoiced that she
was so good. Pardon my folly, sir; but those were moments
of pure, unalloyed bliss. There came one among
us, who, in my dreams and my waking hours of madness,
I have cursed. It was Sinclair, my friend. I will not
enter further into the details of my history. I will not
relate to you the causes which induced me to quit home:
suffice it, however, to say that I was unfortunate. I wrote
to Amelia. The fatal answer and the result of it you are
already acquainted with, and it is to your kindness that I
am indebted for those few days added to a life of insupportable
wretchedness. My nervous system, susceptible
of the slightest shock, my mind weakened by the hereditary
disease of our family, consumption, could not battle
against the accumulation of domestic misfortunes, and a
jealous feeling which I harbored of Amelia. I left home:
my misery is now complete; my former suspicions have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
proved true. She is faithless! This, sir, is all: bear with
me but a short time, and then I will tell you the rest. I
feel myself sinking; listen. Oh, God! oh, God!&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He gasped for breath; the muscles of his face
worked as if struggling to retain life; his eyes became
fixed; his lips muttered sounds,&mdash;they were unmeaning.
I took his hand: it was cold and stiff. I gazed upon his
face: Death&#8217;s seal was set forever!</p>

<p>It was a cold, dreary morning in the month of December,
a heavy snow lay upon the ground, and the wind
whistled around the northeast corner of the post-office; the
streets were nearly deserted; none ventured out but those
whose business rendered it absolutely necessary. I sat at
the window watching the flakes of snow as they peeled
from the roofs of the opposite houses and scattered their
whitened particles on the pavement beneath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p>The Southern mail had arrived, and all the business-letters
were delivered; a drowsy feeling crept over me, and
I was just falling into the Lethean lake of forgetfulness,&mdash;that
dreamy portion of our life, without which this paradise,
this glorious world, with its riches and its charms,
would be as a howling desert.</p>

<p class="center f8">&#8220;Sleep, sweet restorer, balmy sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I am digressing. I was awakened from my slumber
by a slight touch upon the elbow and a tremulous voice
uttering the words, &#8220;Sir! sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam!&#8221; cried I, starting up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to disturb you, sir, but I wish to know if
there are any letters from my son?&#8221;</p>

<p>Honest creature: she looked the picture of distress; the
widow of hope as well as kin, her age apparently about
fifty, her dress neat but indicating poverty,&mdash;the hand of
Time had furrowed her cheek and left his impress there.</p>

<p>&#8220;From your son, madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, my only son: a good, brave boy, and my
only dependence; he lives in New Orleans, and sends me
my little allowance every month. Is there any, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Williams, sir,&mdash;Mary Williams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are two letters, ma&#8217;am, for Mary Williams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is me, sir; and that is his handwriting, dear,
good boy! he never will forget his aged mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty cents, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty cents, sir! my William always pays for the
letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this instance he has failed to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you said, ma&#8217;am, that your son sends you a
monthly allowance: so probably one of these letters contains
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was opened, and, as I anticipated, a ten-dollar
bill was enclosed.</p>

<p>After the departure of the old lady I began to weave
an imaginary tale from the simple incident attending her
appearance. Her son was in New Orleans: it was true,
the season was healthy,&mdash;the winter there being in point
of salubrity the very antipodes of the summer,&mdash;still, an
undefined presentiment of a something yet in embryo
glided across my brain. I noted down the facts that had
already occurred, and in the mean time gathered materials
for other tales.</p>

<p>Two months passed away, and a letter remained in the
post-office for Mrs. Mary Williams. In taking it up I
accidentally noticed the careless manner in which it was
folded. The following scraps of sentences were distinct
and legible:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business very dull&mdash;but two dollars a day&mdash;sickness&mdash;doctor&#8217;s
bill&mdash;I never go to the gambling-house&mdash;what
made you think so?&mdash;send money next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident from this that William had got into bad
company, and although he denied frequenting the gambling-houses,
those sinks of iniquity, those common sewers
for draining from the weak and dissipated their hard
earnings, yet I felt assured that he was lost, and his
mother left in her old days poor and destitute, relying
upon the cold charity of the world for the common means
of subsistence. Her brave and noble boy, as she had
fondly called him, was now drawn into the vortex of vice,
from whose baneful and impetuous influence the tears,
the cries, the agonizing grief of her who doted upon
him, to whose existence her whole soul seemed linked,
could not rescue him. The spark of filial affection was
extinguished, and the love of pleasures, the gratification
of passions, dissipation, and debauchery, had usurped its
place. The winter was now passed away with its wrath:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
storms and tempests with their hail, rain, and snow were
rushing down the tide of time, and spring was seen smiling
in the dim perspective. It was, I think, in the early part
of March, when Mrs. Williams stood at the window. Her
whole appearance was changed. I forgot to mention she
had previously sent for and received the letter to which I
have above alluded. Sickness and sorrow had done their
work. Her eyes were sunken, her cheeks more furrowed,
and poverty still more strikingly displayed in her person.
To her question, &#8220;Are there any letters for me?&#8221; that
powerful monosyllable &#8220;No!&#8221; was another shock to the
poor mother. She stood a while in silence, the tears rolled
down her cheeks, she struggled a while to restrain her
feelings, then fast flowed the sorrowing waters from a
heart surcharged with grief. She turned to depart, but
faltered, and at length overcome, she sat down upon the
steps of the post-office and wept aloud.</p>

<p>There is something unnatural in the weeping of the
aged. Youth is the seed-time of the harvest, and hath
its sunshine and clouds. But age is the garnered fruit,
the sere and the yellow leaf of all that was beautiful.
When age weeps, &#8217;tis for youth, not for itself. I gazed on
the heart-broken woman before me, and thought of her
many nights and days of anguish. I thought of all her
bright visions of hope and joy which shone through her
son and lighted the path of her future. They were all
vanished, and here she lay in utter darkness and desolation.</p>

<p>I spoke to her: she looked up. I told her if she would
leave her address I would send a letter, as soon as it came,
to her home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;I have none! Yes, yes, I
have!&#8221; Reader, it was the poor-house!</p>

<p>Week after week elapsed: no letter came for the aged
widow. One day I accidentally took up a New Orleans
paper. Curiosity prompted me to read it more carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
than usual: the paper fell from my hand; my worst apprehensions
for Mary Williams were realized.</p>

<p class="center padl1"><span class="gesperrt">*******</span></p>

<p>I stood at the bedside of the widow,&mdash;she lay on one
of straw, beside which stood a table containing sundry
bottles of medicine, and near her a Bible, upon which
were a pair of common steel spectacles, black and rusted
with age. She instantly recognized me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you have brought me a letter from my dear boy.
I knew he would not, could not, desert his poor mother.
How is he? where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p class="center padl1"><span class="gesperrt">*******</span></p>

<p>Reader, here I close my sketch, the remembrance of
which haunts me still, and the last sigh, the last pang of
the heart-broken widow will be as the monitor to prompt
me to deeds of charity, with a heart alive to the cries of
the suffering, and a feeling of joy at their alleviation which
I could not previously have experienced.</p>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>THE SIREN.</i></h3>

<p>The morning was one in May, the first of the month.
All nature was smiling and putting forth, like the gay
daughters of earth, her ever-beauteous charms. I had
just returned from a long ramble in the country, and reluctantly
seated myself at the window to distribute the
thoughts, the opinions, the love, the hatred, the wisdom,
and the follies of mankind through the medium of letters.</p>

<p>Passing over several commonplace, every-day applicants,
I was at last struck with the interesting appearance
of a young lady who could not have attained the age of
eighteen. There was, however, a certain expression of the
countenance, a lurking devil&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;in
her eye, denoting alike ungovernable passions and
a reckless disregard of the consequences attending their
gratification. The study of human nature for years, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
a close observation of all its wire-workings <i>and mappings
of the face</i>, which my position had a tendency to improve,
have made me conversant with many of those signs which
the bad passions of the human heart cannot keep in its
deep recess, but send forth as warnings to the young and
unwary to shun them as they would a pestilence. She
gave her name as Caroline Somerville. There were fourteen
letters to her address, the postage of which amounted
to nearly three dollars. Her correspondence seemed to
embrace the four quarters of the globe: for amongst them
were two ship letters,&mdash;one from Bordeaux, the other from
a small town in Scotland. I immediately set her down as
one of our best female customers.</p>

<p>I think it was on the third day from her first application
at the office that I noticed in her handwriting a note
addressed to a merchant of this city,&mdash;a man of family
and reputed a model of his sex, and a pattern for husbands.
This excited an unusual excitement within me.</p>

<p>What could she have to do with Middleton? There
was nothing in common between them. His situation in
life, his moral character and standing in society were all
opposed to the bare supposition of such a thing.</p>

<p>In the mean time, by the usual method, I deciphered
the following words: &#8220;Pardon the freedom&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;No. 26
Gaskill Street&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;alone, seven o&#8217;clock&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;drop a note&#8221;:
these were all I could make out; but they were sufficient.
The character and plots of the siren were no longer a
subject of doubt. I knew her as well from those unconnected
sentences as if her whole history had been written
out before me. She was, in the literal sense of the word,
<span class="smcap">A FEMALE SEDUCER</span>.</p>

<p>The next question that presented itself to my mind was,
would Middleton pay any attention to her? That he
would not admitted scarcely a shadow of doubt: he might
probably reply to her note, but only to refuse and remonstrate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
with her upon the folly and imprudence, if not
guilt, of her conduct.</p>

<p>I handed him the letter myself: he remarked immediately
that it was not one of business. The seal was
broken and the letter was read with an eagerness that
surprised me. He placed it carefully in his pocket-book
and departed. Towards evening Caroline received through
me an answer from Mr. Middleton, in which I discovered
he promised to meet her. From that period there came a
change over his dream of life: I could not but mark the
wasted form and haggard looks which others would attribute
to different causes. I possessed the key to unlock
the truth, but <i>that</i> formed no part of my <i>vocation</i>.</p>

<p>Weeks, nay, months, elapsed, and I was only reminded
of this circumstance by the daily appearance of Middleton.
The few short months were as years upon the calendar of
his face, while the curse of memory was dragging him
with an iron grasp to an early tomb. One day he told
me, in a manner evidently intended to convey the request
more as a matter of business than otherwise, to deliver
his letters to no person but himself: &#8220;remember,&#8221; he
repeated, &#8220;to <i>no one</i>, if you please, sir.&#8221; I promised to
follow his instructions strictly. He had his reasons, and
I knew it.</p>

<p>As I had anticipated, his wife, a lovely woman, in the
fulness of life&#8217;s bloom, rich in accomplishments, the <i>observed</i>
of all <i>observers</i>, called at the office; I could detect
beneath the bland smile the canker-worm of domestic
sorrow; the seeds of misery were sown, the harvest was
ripening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any letters here for Mr. Middleton?&#8221;</p>

<p>If I detest any thing in the world, it is the telling of a
white lie; it soon leads to a black one. I replied that
there were, but orders had been given to deliver them to
no person but himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Orders, sir?&mdash;did he leave such orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>She struggled with passion; it was, however, in vain.
The words, &#8220;perjured villain,&#8221; escaped her, and she left
the office.</p>

<p>I could now imagine their domestic scenes,&mdash;conscious
guilt on the one side, injured and insulted innocence on
the other. But even this was doomed to have an end.</p>

<p>A report ran through the city that a murder had been
committed at No. 26 Gaskill Street. Good heavens! The
dwelling of Caroline! I hurried to the scene of blood, and
there lay the dead body of Middleton, and beside him, in
the custody of two officers, his murderer,&mdash;a youthful
paramour of this modern Jezebel.</p>

<p>He forfeited his life upon the gallows, and Caroline
Somerville died of <i>mania a potu</i> in the alms-house.</p>

<p>What became of the wife of the unfortunate Middleton?
the reader may inquire. Do you see that little red frame-house
which stands alone; that one with the neat little
garden connected with it? There resides Mrs. Middleton,
the once happy wife, together with her four small children:
to maintain them she takes in washing. Yes, reader, such,
alas! is her destiny.</p>

<p>The tide of public opinion rolls from crime, even while
it carries upon its bosom many a bark freighted with the
unhallowed cargo, and involves many an innocent victim
in its reckless and overwhelming course. She is now alone
in the world, with none to sympathize, none to alleviate
her anguish. Her little ones are the peopled world in
which she moves; beyond that all is chaos.</p>

<b>Addenda.</b></h2>

<h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><i>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</i></h3>

<p>We had written this portion of our work with feelings
of gratitude to the brave men who achieved the glorious
victory over the rebellious armies of the South, and looked
forward to the time when Abraham Lincoln in triumph
could repeat his words, uttered long before the surrender
of Lee&#8217;s army: &#8220;<i>When the rebellion is crushed, my work is
done.</i>&#8221; That work was done, and four millions of people
were rescued from slavery; not alone from the fact of any
determined opposition to the institution as it was and existed
under the Constitution, but the effect of the rebellion
itself.</p>

<p>Freedom under the administration of Abraham Lincoln
became a reality, what before was but a name,&mdash;a shadow!
He had just reached that point: his labor was nearly done,
armies had surrendered, and the power of the government
fully sustained. The shout of gratitude went up from the
four points of our country, North, South, East, and West,
and was carried to other nations with a rapidity unequalled
in telegraphic or steam history. In the midst of this rejoicing,
at a time when every heart throbbed with pleasurable
emotions and a nation&#8217;s gratitude was about being
manifested by brilliant illuminations and rejoicings, the
demon of hell sent a fiend forth to destroy the life which
had given a new one to our nation.</p>

<p>Our country was an Eden on the morning of the fatal
day whose evening shrouded it in the deepest gloom. All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
nature was joyous, all men happy save those who inaugurated
the rebellion and looked upon the downfall of
slavery as the end of an institution upon which they
sinned and grew rich,&mdash;vampire-like living on the blood
of their fellow-creatures! Abraham Lincoln stood in the
garden, the Eden of our country, the Adam of a new
order of things,&mdash;a recreated world! The tree of liberty
had been planted, its apples had been eaten eighty years
before, and the curse of slavery followed. But now the
tree was clear of its &#8220;Dead Sea fruit,&#8221; which had withered
its branches; anew it blossomed, anew the rich, ripe fruit
of freedom loaded its stems, and hung suspended,&mdash;bright
jewels on a living tree. It was, is, and ever will be the
tree of knowledge to a free and independent people, the
golden fruit of all that is good, whose roots were watered
by the tears of the grateful, and whose soil was enriched
by the blood of those who died in defending it. Abraham
Lincoln stood in this garden, the man of the people, as
was the first man of God. There came up from the four
corners of our land in lightning flashes the congratulations
of twenty-five millions of <i>free</i> people. Proudly there he
stood; the smile on his face was lighted up by the sunshine
of his heart. Then it was that a wretch, whose
vocation and associations had totally demoralized him,
crept into this Eden, wherein all was joy and happiness,&mdash;his
vile nature, envying a nation&#8217;s return to peace, aimed
to destroy it. The name of this serpent was J. Wilkes
Booth, the tool of Southern chivalry, the assassin by
whose hand Abraham Lincoln fell. The moment that
the spirit of this martyr passed from earth to heaven, the
chains fell from the limbs of four millions of people, and
the doom of slavery was sealed forever! The 14th of
April, 1865, may be dated as an era in our country&#8217;s
history long to be remembered, for Abraham Lincoln died
in carrying out his great work of emancipation. He lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
to see the last battle fought, lived till the power of the
rebellion was broken, and then, having finished the work
for which God had sent him, he passed away from this
world to that high and glorious realm where the patriot
and the good shall live forever.</p>

Germany and Italy, by Roger, Count of Thurn and Taxis. His successors
received from the Emperor of Germany repeated <i>enfeoffments</i> of the imperial

Venice, Genoa, Leghorn, and Naples were thus connected with Hamburg,
Bremen, Lubeck, and Frankfort-on-the-Main; and the active commerce
which had sprung up between these cities became facilitated by such
postal advantages as the system afforded. The Counts of Thurn and
Taxis retained their postal monopoly till the fall of the German Empire.</p></div>

then, as is the custom in the East at present, were sent in most cases
without being sealed; while those addressed to persons of distinction
were placed in a valuable purse, or bag, which was tied, closed over
with clay or wax, and so stamped with the writer&#8217;s signet. The Roman
scrinium, or book-case, a very costly cabinet, shows how these rolls were
preserved. They were put in lengthwise, and labeled at top.</p></div>

when we take into consideration the fact that all England was witch-mad,
and the epidemic raged there subsequent to those atrocities which
disgraced our colonial history. Even now the blush of shame reflects its
hue on those pages devoted to witchcraft in New England, from the
cheeks of those who cannot read our country&#8217;s history without referring
to them. During the seventeenth century 40,000 persons are said to
have been put to death for witchcraft in England alone. In Scotland
the number was probably, in proportion to the population, much
greater; for it is certain that even in the last forty years of the sixteenth
century the executions were not fewer than 17,000. In 1643 the
madness may be said to have reached its highest pitch; for in that year
occurred the celebrated case of the Lancashire witches, in which eight
innocent persons were deprived of their lives by the inherent falsehoods
of a mischievous urchin. The civil war, far from suspending the prosecution,
seemed to have redoubled it. In 1644-45 the infamous
Matthew Hopkins was able to earn a livelihood by the profession of
witch-finder, which he exercised, not indeed without occasional suspicion,
but still with general success. And even twenty years later
the delusion was still sanctioned by the most venerable name of the
English law!</p></div>

corporation of the Middle Dutch Church, and was their place of worship
from the close of the seventeenth century until 1844. Up to that
period it was the oldest church-edifice remaining in the city. A great
part of the wood-work of the steeple, completely wrought, was brought
from Holland. The building itself was of stone. During the Revolution
it was near the upper verge of the city, its location being upon
Nassau, Cedar, and Liberty Streets. When the British took possession
of the city in 1776, they used it as a barracks for the soldiers. It
was afterwards converted into a hospital, and finally the pews were
removed and it was made a riding-school. In 1790 it was repaired,
and again devoted to the worship of God. It was purchased by the
General Government in 1861, for the purpose of a post-office, for
$250,000.</p></div>

and part of the eighth of this series. The rest were written by J. B.,
probably Joseph Breintnail, a member of the <i>junto</i>, whom Franklin describes
as a &#8220;good-natured, friendly, middle-aged man, a great lover

tolerable; very ingenious in making little nicknackeries, and of sensible

kind was used in 1778. When the American army entered Philadelphia,
in June, 1778, upon the evacuation of the English troops, there was a
want of paper fitted for the construction of cartridges. It was advertised
for, and but a small quantity procured. An order was then issued
demanding its instant production by all people in that city who had it.
This produced but little, and most probably on account of its scarcity.
A file of soldiers was then ordered to make search for it in every place
where any was likely to be found. Among other places visited in July,
1778, was a garret in a house in which Benjamin Franklin had previously
had his printing-office. Here were discovered about twenty-five
hundred copies of a sermon which the Rev. Gilbert Tennent had
written (printed by Franklin) upon &#8220;Defensive War,&#8221; to rouse the
colonists during the French troubles. They were all taken and used
as cases for musket-cartridges, and at once sent to the army; and most
of them were used at the battle of Monmouth. The requisites in cartridge-paper
were, of course, thinness, strength, pliability, and inflammability;
and such paper was necessarily scarce then.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">54</span></a> For a number of these addresses the author is indebted to that excellent
paper entitled the &#8220;United States Mail.&#8221;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">55</span></a> There is a small paper published in Albany, New York, entitled
the &#8220;Stamp Collector&#8217;s Record.&#8221; It is entirely devoted to the <i>cause</i>
of stamps and their collectors. It furnishes also considerable information
upon the subject in connection with foreign stamps.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">56</span></a> The number of individuals employed in the English post-office is
very considerable. On the 31st of December, 1857, it gave employment
to twenty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty-one persons, while
the number has been since considerably increased. More than two
thousand of these clerks are employed in the chief office in London.
The number of persons employed in the post-office of France amounts
to twenty-six thousand and seventy-one; but then it should be remembered
that the extent and population of France are greater than the
extent and population of Great Britain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">57</span></a> It may be added here that these deliveries are distinct from what
is termed the &#8220;general delivery.&#8221; As all the principal mails arrive in
London in the morning, there are but three deliveries a day by the
carriers of the general post. These carriers are distinguished from
those belonging to the two-penny post or city delivery by wearing the
livery of the department, viz.: a scarlet coat with a blue collar, and
buttons stamped with an impression of the royal arms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">58</span></a> Persons anxious to examine more closely into this subject, which,
however, is now settled, no doubt finally, by a compromise with the
parties, are referred to the opinion of the court, &#8220;United States <i>vs.</i>
Kochersperger,&#8221; in report of the postmaster-general for the year 1860.</p></div>
